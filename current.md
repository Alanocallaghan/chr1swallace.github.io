[[http://ollyburren.github.io][Olly Burren]] is undertaking a PhD, researching methods to integrate genomic and genetic datasets to better understand autoimmune disease mechanisms. He was previously head of Genome Informatics in the [[https://www-gene.cimr.cam.ac.uk/][Diabetes and Inflammation Laboratory]] where he was responsible for the creation and smooth running of the [[http://www.immunobase.org][ImmunoBase]],  [[http://www.t1dbase.org][T1DBase]] and [[http://www.chicp.org][CHiCP]] web resources which collate data and summary information from genomic, GWAS and ImmunoChip analyses of autoimmune diseases.  He continues to maintain  [[http://www.chicp.org][CHiCP]] as a means of visualizing Capture Hi-C datasets.
