Chris Wallace is a [[http://www.wellcome.ac.uk][Wellcome Trust]] Research Career Development Fellow,
 head of the [[https://www-gene.cimr.cam.ac.uk/staff/dilstats/][statistics group]] in the Wellcome Trust/JDRF [[http://www-gene.cimr.cam.ac.uk][Diabetes and Inflammation
 Laboratory]] at Cambridge, and a visitor at the [[http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk][MRC Biostatistics Unit]].
My group is based in the [[http://www.cimr.cam.ac.uk][Cambridge Institute for Medical Research]].

Our immune system protects us against infectious disease, but
sometimes attacks our own cells, causing autoimmune disease.  My group
use statistical analysis of genetic and genomic datasets to understand
the genes, cells and pathways involved in the aetiology of autoimmune
diseases such as type 1 diabetes and the relationships between
different autoimmune diseases.  Our goal is to further the
understanding of these diseases in order to help prevent and treat
them.

These pages exist to store information about datasets and code used in
papers from our group.  The aim is to make this information accessible,
which is not always possible in the published papers.
