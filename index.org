I am a [[http://www.wellcome.ac.uk][Wellcome Trust]]
Research Career Development Fellow, and head of the [[https://www-gene.cimr.cam.ac.uk/staff/dilstats/][statistics group]] in the 
[[http://www-gene.cimr.cam.ac.uk][Diabetes and Inflammation Laboratory]] at Cambridge.  I am also a visitor at the [[http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk][MRC Biostatistics Unit]].

As a statistician, I work with biological datasets to understand the
mechanisms underlying human disease and identify possible treatments.
Such work is only possible with close collaboration with biologists,
and I moved to the [[http://www.cimr.cam.ac.uk][CIMR]] in 2009 to pursue these collaborations.
During the GWAS era, we, and others, identified many genetic
polymorphisms that alter risk of human diseases such as type 1
diabetes and hypertension.  My focus has now mostly shifted towards
understanding the cell specific mechanism through which these variants
affect risk of different immune mediated diseases and intermediate
biological traits such as gene expression.  Statistically, my current
work is focused on variable selection, Bayesian model averaging and
empirical Bayes false discovery rates, applied to integrated analysis
of multiple related datasets.

I contribute to the [[http://dilstats.wordpress.com][DILstats blog]], where you can find details of
recent papers from our group, and keep notes about R and other
code at my [[http://cwcode.wordpress.com][code blog]].

These pages exist to store information about datasets and code used in
papers from my group.  The aim is to make this information accessible,
which is not always possible in the published papers.
