  <!--   <p>Many common diseases show wide phenotypic variation. We present a statistical method for determining whether phenotypically defined subgroups of disease cases represent different genetic pathophysiologies, in which disease-associated variants have different effect sizes in the two subgroups. Our method models the genome-wide distributions of genetic association statistics with mixture Gaussians. We apply a global test without requiring explicit identification of disease-associated variants, thus maximising power in comparison to a standard variant by variant subgroup analysis. Where evidence for genetic subgrouping is found, we present methods for post-hoc identification of the contributing genetic variants. We demonstrate the method on a range of simulated and test datasets where expected results are already known. We investigate subgroups of type 1 diabetes (T1D) cases defined by autoantibody positivity, establishing evidence for differential genetic basis with thyroid peroxidase antibody positivity, driven generally by variants in known T1D associated regions.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>Seasonal variations are rarely considered a contributing component to human tissue function or health, although many diseases and physiological process display annual periodicities. Here we find more than 4,000 protein-coding mRNAs in white blood cells and adipose tissue to have seasonal expression profiles, with inverted patterns observed between Europe and Oceania. We also find the cellular composition of blood to vary by season, and these changes, which differ between the United Kingdom and The Gambia, could explain the gene expression periodicity. With regards to tissue function, the immune system has a profound pro-inflammatory transcriptomic profile during European winter, with increased levels of soluble IL-6 receptor and C-reactive protein, risk biomarkers for cardiovascular, psychiatric and autoimmune diseases that have peak incidences in winter. Circannual rhythms thus require further exploration as contributors to various aspects of human physiology and disease.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>Type 1 diabetes results from the autoimmune destruction of insulin-secreting pancreatic beta cells by T cells. Despite the established role of T cells in the pathogenesis of the disease, to date, with the exception of the identification of islet-specific T effector (Teff) cells, studies have mostly failed to identify reproducible alterations in the frequency or function of T cell subsets in peripheral blood from patients with type 1 diabetes.We assessed the production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-21, IFN-γ and IL-17 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 69 patients with type 1 diabetes and 61 healthy donors. In an additional cohort of 30 patients with type 1 diabetes and 32 healthy donors, we assessed the frequency of circulating T follicular helper (Tfh) cells in whole blood. IL-21 and IL-17 production was also measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a subset of 46 of the 62 donors immunophenotyped for Tfh.We found a 21.9% (95% CI 5.8, 40.2; p = 3.9 × 10(-3)) higher frequency of IL-21(+) CD45RA(-) memory CD4(+) Teffs in patients with type 1 diabetes (geometric mean 5.92% [95% CI 5.44, 6.44]) compared with healthy donors (geometric mean 4.88% [95% CI 4.33, 5.50]). Consistent with this finding, we found a 14.9% increase in circulating Tfh cells in the patients (95% CI 2.9, 26.9; p = 0.016).These results indicate that increased IL-21 production is likely to be an aetiological factor in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes that could be considered as a potential therapeutic target.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>The genes and cells that mediate genetic associations identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are only partially understood. Several studies that have investigated the genetic regulation of gene expression have shown that disease-associated variants are over-represented amongst expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) variants. Evidence for colocalisation of eQTL and disease causal variants can suggest causal genes and cells for these genetic associations. Here, we used colocalisation analysis to investigate whether 595 genetic associations to ten immune-mediated diseases are consistent with a causal variant that regulates, in cis, gene expression in resting B cells, and in resting and stimulated monocytes. Previously published candidate causal genes were over-represented amongst genes exhibiting colocalisation (odds ratio > 1.5), and we identified evidence for colocalisation (posterior odds > 5) between cis eQTLs in at least one cell type and at least one disease for six genes: ADAM15, RGS1, CARD9, LTBR, CTSH and SYNGR1. We identified cell-specific effects, such as for CTSH, the expression of which in monocytes, but not in B cells, may mediate type 1 diabetes and narcolepsy associations in the chromosome 15q25.1 region. Our results demonstrate the utility of integrating genetic studies of disease and gene expression for highlighting causal genes and cell types.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>Identification of candidate causal variants in regions associated with risk of common diseases is complicated by linkage disequilibrium (LD) and multiple association signals. Nonetheless, accurate maps of these variants are needed, both to fully exploit detailed cell specific chromatin annotation data to highlight disease causal mechanisms and cells, and for design of the functional studies that will ultimately be required to confirm causal mechanisms. We adapted a Bayesian evolutionary stochastic search algorithm to the fine mapping problem, and demonstrated its improved performance over conventional stepwise and regularised regression through simulation studies. We then applied it to fine map the established multiple sclerosis (MS) and type 1 diabetes (T1D) associations in the IL-2RA (CD25) gene region. For T1D, both stepwise and stochastic search approaches identified four T1D association signals, with the major effect tagged by the single nucleotide polymorphism, rs12722496. In contrast, for MS, the stochastic search found two distinct competing models: a single candidate causal variant, tagged by rs2104286 and reported previously using stepwise analysis; and a more complex model with two association signals, one of which was tagged by the major T1D associated rs12722496 and the other by rs56382813. There is low to moderate LD between rs2104286 and both rs12722496 and rs56382813 (r2 ≃ 0:3) and our two SNP model could not be recovered through a forward stepwise search after conditioning on rs2104286. Both signals in the two variant model for MS affect CD25 expression on distinct subpopulations of CD4+ T cells, which are key cells in the autoimmune process. The results support a shared causal variant for T1D and MS. Our study illustrates the benefit of using a purposely designed model search strategy for fine mapping and the advantage of combining disease and protein expression data.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory arthritis associated with psoriasis and, despite the larger estimated heritability for PsA, the majority of genetic susceptibility loci identified to date are shared with psoriasis. Here, we present results from a case-control association study on 1,962 PsA patients and 8,923 controls using the Immunochip genotyping array. We identify eight loci passing genome-wide significance, secondary independent effects at three loci and a distinct PsA-specific variant at the IL23R locus. We report two novel loci and evidence of a novel PsA-specific association at chromosome 5q31. Imputation of classical HLA alleles, amino acids and SNPs across the MHC region highlights three independent associations to class I genes. Finally, we find an enrichment of associated variants to markers of open chromatin in CD8(+) memory primary T cells. This study identifies key insights into the genetics of PsA that could begin to explain fundamental differences between psoriasis and PsA.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>Determining whether potential causal variants for related diseases are shared can identify overlapping etiologies of multifactorial disorders. Colocalization methods disentangle shared and distinct causal variants. However, existing approaches require independent data sets. Here we extend two colocalization methods to allow for the shared-control design commonly used in comparison of genome-wide association study results across diseases. Our analysis of four autoimmune diseases-type 1 diabetes (T1D), rheumatoid arthritis, celiac disease and multiple sclerosis-identified 90 regions that were associated with at least one disease, 33 (37%) of which were associated with 2 or more disorders. Nevertheless, for 14 of these 33 shared regions, there was evidence that the causal variants differed. We identified new disease associations in 11 regions previously associated with one or more of the other 3 disorders. Four of eight T1D-specific regions contained known type 2 diabetes (T2D) candidate genes (COBL, GLIS3, RNLS and BCAR1), suggesting a shared cellular etiology.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>Genetic studies of type 1 diabetes (T1D) have identified 50 susceptibility regions, finding major pathways contributing to risk, with some loci shared across immune disorders. To make genetic comparisons across autoimmune disorders as informative as possible, a dense genotyping array, the Immunochip, was developed, from which we identified four new T1D-associated regions (P < 5 × 10(-8)). A comparative analysis with 15 immune diseases showed that T1D is more similar genetically to other autoantibody-positive diseases, significantly most similar to juvenile idiopathic arthritis and significantly least similar to ulcerative colitis, and provided support for three additional new T1D risk loci. Using a Bayesian approach, we defined credible sets for the T1D-associated SNPs. The associated SNPs localized to enhancer sequences active in thymus, T and B cells, and CD34(+) stem cells. Enhancer-promoter interactions can now be analyzed in these cell types to identify which particular genes and regulatory sequences are causal.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with many traits and diseases. However, at existing sample sizes, these variants explain only part of the estimated heritability. Leverage of GWAS results from related phenotypes may improve detection without the need for larger datasets. The Bayesian conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) constitutes an upper bound on the expected false discovery rate (FDR) across a set of SNPs whose p values for two diseases are both less than two disease-specific thresholds. Calculation of the cFDR requires only summary statistics and have several advantages over traditional GWAS analysis. However, existing methods require distinct control samples between studies. Here, we extend the technique to allow for some or all controls to be shared, increasing applicability. Several different SNP sets can be defined with the same cFDR value, and we show that the expected FDR across the union of these sets may exceed expected FDR in any single set. We describe a procedure to establish an upper bound for the expected FDR among the union of such sets of SNPs. We apply our technique to pairwise analysis of p values from ten autoimmune diseases with variable sharing of controls, enabling discovery of 59 SNP-disease associations which do not reach GWAS significance after genomic control in individual datasets. Most of the SNPs we highlight have previously been confirmed using replication studies or larger GWAS, a useful validation of our technique; we report eight SNP-disease associations across five diseases not previously declared. Our technique extends and strengthens the previous algorithm, and establishes robust limits on the expected FDR. This approach can improve SNP detection in GWAS, and give insight into shared aetiology between phenotypically related conditions.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many loci implicated in disease susceptibility. Integration of GWAS summary statistics (P-values) and functional genomic datasets should help to elucidate mechanisms.We extended a non-parametric SNP set enrichment method to test for enrichment of GWAS signals in functionally defined loci to a situation where only GWAS P-values are available. The approach is implemented in VSEAMS, a freely available software pipeline. We use VSEAMS to identify enrichment of type 1 diabetes (T1D) GWAS associations near genes that are targets for the transcription factors IKZF3, BATF and ESRRA. IKZF3 lies in a known T1D susceptibility region, while BATF and ESRRA overlap other immune disease susceptibility regions, validating our approach and suggesting novel avenues of research for T1D.

  <!--   <p>Killer Immunoglobulin-like Receptors (KIRs) are surface receptors of natural killer cells that bind to their corresponding Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class I ligands, making them interesting candidate genes for HLA-associated autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, allelic and copy number variation in the KIR region effectively mask it from standard genome-wide association studies: single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) probes targeting the region are often discarded by standard genotype callers since they exhibit variable cluster numbers. Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) assays address this issue. However, their cost is prohibitive at the sample sizes required for detecting effects typically observed in complex genetic diseases.We propose a more powerful and cost-effective alternative, which combines signals from SNPs with more than three clusters found in existing datasets, with qPCR on a subset of samples. First, we showed that noise and batch effects in multiplexed qPCR assays are addressed through normalisation and simultaneous copy number calling of multiple genes. Then, we used supervised classification to impute copy numbers of specific KIR genes from SNP signals. We applied this method to assess copy number variation in two KIR genes, KIR3DL1 and KIR3DS1, which are suitable candidates for T1D susceptibility since they encode the only KIR molecules known to bind with HLA-Bw4 epitopes. We find no association between KIR3DL1/3DS1 copy number and T1D in 6744 cases and 5362 controls; a sample size twenty-fold larger than in any previous KIR association study. Due to our sample size, we can exclude odds ratios larger than 1.1 for the common KIR3DL1/3DS1 copy number groups at the 5% significance level.We found no evidence of association of KIR3DL1/3DS1 copy number with T1D, either overall or dependent on HLA-Bw4 epitope. Five other KIR genes, KIR2DS4, KIR2DL3, KIR2DL5, KIR2DS5 and KIR2DS1, in high linkage disequilibrium with KIR3DL1 and KIR3DS1, are also unlikely to be significantly associated. Our approach could potentially be applied to other KIR genes to allow cost effective assaying of gene copy number in large samples.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>The appearance of circulating islet-specific autoantibodies before disease diagnosis is a hallmark of human type 1 diabetes (T1D), and suggests a role for B cells in the pathogenesis of the disease. Alterations in the peripheral B cell compartment have been reported in T1D patients; however, to date, such studies have produced conflicting results and have been limited by sample size. In this study, we have performed a detailed characterization of the B cell compartment in T1D patients (n = 45) and healthy controls (n = 46), and assessed the secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 in purified B cells from the same donors. Overall, we found no evidence for a profound alteration of the B cell compartment or in the production of IL-10 in peripheral blood of T1D patients. We also investigated age-related changes in peripheral B cell subsets and confirmed the sharp decrease with age of transitional CD19(+) CD27(-) CD24(hi) CD38(hi) B cells, a subset that has recently been ascribed a putative regulatory function. Genetic analysis of the B cell compartment revealed evidence for association of the IL2-IL21 T1D locus with IL-10 production by both memory B cells (P = 6·4 × 10(-4) ) and islet-specific CD4(+) T cells (P = 2·9 × 10(-3) ). In contrast to previous reports, we found no evidence for an alteration of the B cell compartment in healthy individuals homozygous for the non-synonymous PTPN22 Trp(620) T1D risk allele (rs2476601; Arg(620) Trp). The IL2-IL21 association we have identified, if confirmed, suggests a novel role for B cells in T1D pathogenesis through the production of IL-10, and reinforces the importance of IL-10 production by autoreactive CD4(+) T cells.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>Diagnosis of the autoimmune disease type 1 diabetes (T1D) is preceded by the appearance of circulating autoantibodies to pancreatic islets. However, almost nothing is known about events leading to this islet autoimmunity. Previous epidemiological and genetic data have associated viral infections and anti-viral type I interferon (IFN) immune response genes with T1D. Here, we first used DNA microarray analysis to identify IFN-Î² inducible genes in vitro and then used this set of genes to define an IFN-inducible transcriptional signature in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a group of active systemic lupus erythematosus patients (N=25). Using this predefined set of 225 IFN signature genes, we investigated expression of the signature in cohorts of healthy controls (N=87), T1D patients (N=64) and a large longitudinal birth cohort of children genetically predisposed to T1D (N=109; 454 microarrayed samples). Expression of the IFN signature was increased in genetically-predisposed children prior to the development of autoantibodies (P=0.0012), but not in established T1D patients. Upregulation of IFN-inducible genes was transient, temporally associated with a recent history of upper respiratory tract infections (P=0.0064) and marked by increased expression of SIGLEC-1 (CD169), a lectin-like receptor expressed on CD14(+) monocytes. DNA variation in IFN-inducible genes altered T1D risk (P=0.007), as exemplified by IFIH1, one of the genes in our IFN signature and for which increased expression is a known disease risk factor. These findings identify transient increased expression of type I IFN genes in pre-clinical diabetes as a risk factor for autoimmunity in children with a genetic predisposition to T1D.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>Type 1 diabetes is a common autoimmune disease that has genetic and environmental determinants. Variations within the IL2 and IL2RA (also known as CD25) gene regions are associated with disease risk, and variation in expression or function of these proteins is likely to be causal. We aimed to investigate if circulating concentrations of the soluble form of CD25, sCD25, an established marker of immune activation and inflammation, were increased in individuals with type 1 diabetes and if this was associated with the concentration of C-peptide, a measure of insulin production that reflects the degree of autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells.We used immunoassays to measure sCD25 and C-peptide in peripheral blood plasma from patient and control samples.We identified that sCD25 was increased in patients with type 1 diabetes compared with controls and replicated this result in an independent set of 86 adult patient and 80 age-matched control samples (pâ=â1.17âÃâ10(-3)). In 230 patients under 20Â years of age, with median duration-of-disease of 6.1Â years, concentrations of sCD25 were negatively associated with C-peptide concentrations (pâ=â4.8âÃâ10(-3)).The 25% increase in sCD25 in patients, alongside the inverse association between sCD25 and C-peptide, probably reflect the adverse effects of an on-going, actively autoimmune and inflammatory immune system on beta cell function in patients.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>Pathway analysis can complement point-wise single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis in exploring genomewide association study (GWAS) data to identify specific disease-associated genes that can be candidate causal genes. We propose a straightforward methodology that can be used for conducting a gene-based pathway analysis using summary GWAS statistics in combination with widely available reference genotype data. We used this method to perform a gene-based pathway analysis of a type 1 diabetes (T1D) meta-analysis GWAS (of 7,514 cases and 9,045 controls). An important feature of the conducted analysis is the removal of the major histocompatibility complex gene region, the major genetic risk factor for T1D. Thirty-one of the 1,583 (2%) tested pathways were identified to be enriched for association with T1D at a 5% false discovery rate. We analyzed these 31 pathways and their genes to identify SNPs in or near these pathway genes that showed potentially novel association with T1D and attempted to replicate the association of 22 SNPs in additional samples. Replication P-values were skewed (P=9.85Ã10-11) with 12 of the 22 SNPs showing P<0.05. Support, including replication evidence, was obtained for nine T1D associated variants in genes ITGB7 (rs11170466, P=7.86Ã10-9), NRP1 (rs722988, 4.88Ã10-8), BAD (rs694739, 2.37Ã10-7), CTSB (rs1296023, 2.79Ã10-7), FYN (rs11964650, P=5.60Ã10-7), UBE2G1 (rs9906760, 5.08Ã10-7), MAP3K14 (rs17759555, 9.67Ã10-7), ITGB1 (rs1557150, 1.93Ã10-6), and IL7R (rs1445898, 2.76Ã10-6). The proposed methodology can be applied to other GWAS datasets for which only summary level data are available.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>Genetic association studies, in particular the genome-wide association study (GWAS) design, have provided a wealth of novel insights into the aetiology of a wide range of human diseases and traits, in particular cardiovascular diseases and lipid biomarkers. The next challenge consists of understanding the molecular basis of these associations. The integration of multiple association datasets, including gene expression datasets, can contribute to this goal. We have developed a novel statistical methodology to assess whether two association signals are consistent with a shared causal variant. An application is the integration of disease scans with expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies, but any pair of GWAS datasets can be integrated in this framework. We demonstrate the value of the approach by re-analysing a gene expression dataset in 966 liver samples with a published meta-analysis of lipid traits including >100,000 individuals of European ancestry. Combining all lipid biomarkers, our re-analysis supported 26 out of 38 reported colocalisation results with eQTLs and identified 14 new colocalisation results, hence highlighting the value of a formal statistical test. In three cases of reported eQTL-lipid pairs (SYPL2, IFT172, TBKBP1) for which our analysis suggests that the eQTL pattern is not consistent with the lipid association, we identify alternative colocalisation results with SORT1, GCKR, and KPNB1, indicating that these genes are more likely to be causal in these genomic intervals. A key feature of the method is the ability to derive the output statistics from single SNP summary statistics, hence making it possible to perform systematic meta-analysis type comparisons across multiple GWAS datasets (implemented online at http://coloc.cs.ucl.ac.uk/coloc/). Our methodology provides information about candidate causal genes in associated intervals and has direct implications for the understanding of complex diseases as well as the design of drugs to target disease pathways.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for type 1 diabetes (T1D) have successfully identified more than 40 independent T1D associated tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, owing to technical limitations of copy number variants (CNVs) genotyping assays, the assessment of the role of CNVs has been limited to the subset of these in high linkage disequilibrium with tag SNPs. The contribution of untagged CNVs, often multi-allelic and difficult to genotype using existing assays, to the heritability of T1D remains an open question. To investigate this issue, we designed a custom comparative genetic hybridization array (aCGH) specifically designed to assay untagged CNV loci identified from a variety of sources. To overcome the technical limitations of the case control design for this class of CNVs, we genotyped the Type 1 Diabetes Genetics Consortium (T1DGC) family resource (representing 3,903 transmissions from parents to affected offspring) and used an association testing strategy that does not necessitate obtaining discrete genotypes. Our design targeted 4,309 CNVs, of which 3,410 passed stringent quality control filters. As a positive control, the scan confirmed the known T1D association at the INS locus by direct typing of the 5’ variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) locus. Our results clarify the fact that the disease association is indistinguishable from the two main polymorphic allele classes of the INS VNTR, class I-and class III. We also identified novel technical artifacts resulting into spurious associations at the somatically rearranging loci, T cell receptor, TCRA/TCRD and TCRB, and Immunoglobulin heavy chain, IGH, loci on chromosomes 14q11.2, 7q34 and 14q32.33, respectively. However, our data did not identify novel T1D loci. Our results do not support a major role of untagged CNVs in T1D heritability.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many common variants associated with complex traits, low-frequency and rare variants have not been interrogated in a comprehensive manner. Imputation from dense reference panels, such as the 1000 Genomes Project (1000G), enables testing of ungenotyped variants for association. Here we present the results of imputation using a large, new population-specific panel: the Genome of The Netherlands (GoNL). We benchmarked the performance of the 1000G and GoNL reference sets by comparing imputation genotypes with ’true’ genotypes typed on ImmunoChip in three European populations (Dutch, British, and Italian). GoNL showed significant improvement in the imputation quality for rare variants (MAF 0.05-0.5%) compared with 1000G. In Dutch samples, the mean observed Pearson correlation, r(2), increased from 0.61 to 0.71. We also saw improved imputation accuracy for other European populations (in the British samples, r(2) improved from 0.58 to 0.65, and in the Italians from 0.43 to 0.47). A combined reference set comprising 1000G and GoNL improved the imputation of rare variants even further. The Italian samples benefitted the most from this combined reference (the mean r(2) increased from 0.47 to 0.50). We conclude that the creation of a large population-specific reference is advantageous for imputing rare variants and that a combined reference panel across multiple populations yields the best imputation results.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>Integration of data from genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) association studies of different traits should allow researchers to disentangle the genetics of potentially related traits within individually associated regions. Formal statistical colocalisation testing of individual regions requires selection of a set of SNPs summarising the association in a region. We show that the SNP selection method greatly affects type 1 error rates, with published studies having used methods expected to result in substantially inflated type 1 error rates. We show that either avoiding variable selection and instead testing the most informative principal components or integrating over variable selection using Bayesian model averaging can help control type 1 error rates. Application to data from Graves’ disease and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis reveals a common genetic signature across seven regions shared between the diseases, and indicates that in five of six regions associated with Graves’ disease and not Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, this more likely reflects genuine absence of association with the latter rather than lack of power. Our examination, by simulation, of the performance of colocalisation tests and associated software will foster more widespread adoption of formal colocalisation testing. Given the increasing availability of large expression and genetic association datasets from disease-relevant tissue and purified cell populations, coupled with identification of regulatory sequences by projects such as ENCODE, colocalisation analysis has the potential to reveal both shared genetic signatures of related traits and causal disease genes and tissues.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>As the thymus involutes with age, the maintenance of peripheral naive T cells in humans becomes strongly dependent on peripheral cell division. However, mechanisms that orchestrate homeostatic division remain unclear. In this study we present evidence that the frequency of naive CD4 T cells that express CD25 (IL-2 receptor Î±-chain) increases with age on subsets of both CD31(+) and CD31(-) naive CD4 T cells. Analyses of TCR excision circles from sorted subsets indicate that CD25(+) naive CD4 T cells have undergone more rounds of homeostatic proliferation than their CD25(-) counterparts in both the CD31(+) and CD31(-) subsets, indicating that CD25 is a marker of naive CD4 T cells that have preferentially responded to survival signals from self-Ags or cytokines. CD25 expression on CD25(-) naive CD4 T cells can be induced by IL-7 in vitro in the absence of TCR activation. Although CD25(+) naive T cells respond to lower concentrations of IL-2 as compared with their CD25(-) counterparts, IL-2 responsiveness is further increased in CD31(-) naive T cells by their expression of the signaling IL-2 receptor Î²-chain CD122, forming with common Î³-chain functional high-affinity IL-2 receptors. CD25 plays a role during activation: CD25(+) naive T cells stimulated in an APC-dependent manner were shown to produce increased levels of IL-2 as compared with their CD25(-) counterparts. This study establishes CD25(+) naive CD4 T cells, which are further delineated by CD31 expression, as a major functionally distinct immune cell subset in humans that warrants further characterization in health and disease.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>The invention of next-generation sequencing technology has made it possible to study the rare variants that are more likely to pinpoint causal disease genes. To make such experiments financially viable, DNA samples from several subjects are often pooled before sequencing. This induces large between-pool variation which, together with other sources of experimental error, creates over-dispersed data. Statistical analysis of pooled sequencing data needs to appropriately model this additional variance to avoid inflating the false-positive rate.We propose a new statistical method based on an extra-binomial model to address the over-dispersion and apply it to pooled case-control data. We demonstrate that our model provides a better fit to the data than either a standard binomial model or a traditional extra-binomial model proposed by Williams and can analyse both rare and common variants with lower or more variable pool depths compared to the other methods.Package ’extraBinomial’ is on http://cran.r-project.org/.chris.wallace@cimr.cam.ac.uk.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics Online.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>One mechanism by which disease-associated DNA variation can alter disease risk is altering gene expression. However, linkage disequilibrium (LD) between variants, mostly single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), means it is not sufficient to show that a particular variant associates with both disease and expression, as there could be two distinct causal variants in LD. Here, we describe a formal statistical test of colocalization and apply it to type 1 diabetes (T1D)-associated regions identified mostly through genome-wide association studies and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) discovered in a recently determined large monocyte expression data set from the Gutenberg Health Study (1370 individuals), with confirmation sought in an additional data set from the Cardiogenics Transcriptome Study (558 individuals). We excluded 39 out of 60 overlapping eQTLs in 49 T1D regions from possible colocalization and identified 21 coincident eQTLs, representing 21 genes in 14 distinct T1D regions. Our results reflect the importance of monocyte (and their derivatives, macrophage and dendritic cell) gene expression in human T1D and support the candidacy of several genes as causal factors in autoimmune pancreatic beta-cell destruction, including AFF3, CD226, CLECL1, DEXI, FKRP, PRKD2, RNLS, SMARCE1 and SUOX, in addition to the recently described GPR183 (EBI2) gene.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>Autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), including Graves’ disease (GD) and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT), is one of the most common of the immune-mediated diseases. To further investigate the genetic determinants of AITD, we conducted an association study using a custom-made single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, the ImmunoChip. The SNP array contains all known and genotype-able SNPs across 186 distinct susceptibility loci associated with one or more immune-mediated diseases. After stringent quality control, we analysed 103 875 common SNPs (minor allele frequency >0.05) in 2285 GD and 462 HT patients and 9364 controls. We found evidence for seven new AITD risk loci (P < 1.12 Ã 10(-6); a permutation test derived significance threshold), five at locations previously associated and two at locations awaiting confirmation, with other immune-mediated diseases.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>The chromosome 16p13 region has been associated with several autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes (T1D) and multiple sclerosis (MS). CLEC16A has been reported as the most likely candidate gene in the region, since it contains the most disease-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as well as an imunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif. However, here we report that intron 19 of CLEC16A, containing the most autoimmune disease-associated SNPs, appears to behave as a regulatory sequence, affecting the expression of a neighbouring gene, DEXI. The CLEC16A alleles that are protective from T1D and MS are associated with increased expression of DEXI, and no other genes in the region, in two independent monocyte gene expression data sets. Critically, using chromosome conformation capture (3C), we identified physical proximity between the DEXI promoter region and intron 19 of CLEC16A, separated by a loop of >150 kb. In reciprocal experiments, a 20 kb fragment of intron 19 of CLEC16A, containing SNPs associated with T1D and MS, as well as with DEXI expression, interacted with the promotor region of DEXI but not with candidate DNA fragments containing other potential causal genes in the region, including CLEC16A. Intron 19 of CLEC16A is highly enriched for transcription-factor-binding events and markers associated with enhancer activity. Taken together, these data indicate that although the causal variants in the 16p13 region lie within CLEC16A, DEXI is an unappreciated autoimmune disease candidate gene, and illustrate the power of the 3C approach in progressing from genome-wide association studies results to candidate causal genes.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified numerous, replicable, genetic associations between common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and risk of common autoimmune and inflammatory (immune-mediated) diseases, some of which are shared between two diseases. Along with epidemiological and clinical evidence, this suggests that some genetic risk factors may be shared across diseases-as is the case with alleles in the Major Histocompatibility Locus. In this work we evaluate the extent of this sharing for 107 immune disease-risk SNPs in seven diseases: celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and type 1 diabetes. We have developed a novel statistic for Cross Phenotype Meta-Analysis (CPMA) which detects association of a SNP to multiple, but not necessarily all, phenotypes. With it, we find evidence that 47/107 (44%) immune-mediated disease risk SNPs are associated to multiple-but not all-immune-mediated diseases (SNP-wise P(CPMA)<0.01). We also show that distinct groups of interacting proteins are encoded near SNPs which predispose to the same subsets of diseases; we propose these as the mechanistic basis of shared disease risk. We are thus able to leverage genetic data across diseases to construct biological hypotheses about the underlying mechanism of pathogenesis.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>Vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] <50 nmol/L) is commonly reported in both children and adults worldwide, and growing evidence indicates that vitamin D deficiency is associated with many extraskeletal chronic disorders, including the autoimmune diseases type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis.We measured 25(OH)D concentrations in 720 case and 2,610 control plasma samples and genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms from seven vitamin D metabolism genes in 8,517 case, 10,438 control, and 1,933 family samples. We tested genetic variants influencing 25(OH)D metabolism for an association with both circulating 25(OH)D concentrations and disease status.Type 1 diabetic patients have lower circulating levels of 25(OH)D than similarly aged subjects from the British population. Only 4.3 and 18.6% of type 1 diabetic patients reached optimal levels (â¥75 nmol/L) of 25(OH)D for bone health in the winter and summer, respectively. We replicated the associations of four vitamin D metabolism genes (GC, DHCR7, CYP2R1, and CYP24A1) with 25(OH)D in control subjects. In addition to the previously reported association between type 1 diabetes and CYP27B1 (P = 1.4 Ã 10(-4)), we obtained consistent evidence of type 1 diabetes being associated with DHCR7 (P = 1.2 Ã 10(-3)) and CYP2R1 (P = 3.0 Ã 10(-3)).Circulating levels of 25(OH)D in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes vary seasonally and are under the same genetic control as in the general population but are much lower. Three key 25(OH)D metabolism genes show consistent evidence of association with type 1 diabetes risk, indicating a genetic etiological role for vitamin D deficiency in type 1 diabetes.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>Blood pressure is a heritable trait influenced by several biological pathways and responsive to environmental stimuli. Over one billion people worldwide have hypertension (â¥140âmmâHg systolic blood pressure orâ â¥90âmmâHg diastolic blood pressure). Even small increments in blood pressure are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. This genome-wide association study of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, which used a multi-stage design in 200,000 individuals of European descent, identified sixteen novel loci: six of these loci contain genes previously known or suspected to regulate blood pressure (GUCY1A3-GUCY1B3, NPR3-C5orf23, ADM, FURIN-FES, GOSR2, GNAS-EDN3); the other ten provide new clues to blood pressure physiology. A genetic risk score based on 29 genome-wide significant variants was associated with hypertension, left ventricular wall thickness, stroke and coronary artery disease, but not kidney disease or kidney function. We also observed associations with blood pressure in East Asian, South Asian and African ancestry individuals. Our findings provide new insights into the genetics and biology of blood pressure, and suggest potential novel therapeutic pathways for cardiovascular disease prevention.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>Concentrations of liver enzymes in plasma are widely used as indicators of liver disease. We carried out a genome-wide association study in 61,089 individuals, identifying 42 loci associated with concentrations of liver enzymes in plasma, of which 32 are new associations (P = 10(-8) to P = 10(-190)). We used functional genomic approaches including metabonomic profiling and gene expression analyses to identify probable candidate genes at these regions. We identified 69 candidate genes, including genes involved in biliary transport (ATP8B1 and ABCB11), glucose, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism (FADS1, FADS2, GCKR, JMJD1C, HNF1A, MLXIPL, PNPLA3, PPP1R3B, SLC2A2 and TRIB1), glycoprotein biosynthesis and cell surface glycobiology (ABO, ASGR1, FUT2, GPLD1 and ST3GAL4), inflammation and immunity (CD276, CDH6, GCKR, HNF1A, HPR, ITGA1, RORA and STAT4) and glutathione metabolism (GSTT1, GSTT2 and GGT), as well as several genes of uncertain or unknown function (including ABHD12, EFHD1, EFNA1, EPHA2, MICAL3 and ZNF827). Our results provide new insight into genetic mechanisms and pathways influencing markers of liver function.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>The genetic basis of the autoimmune disease type 1 diabetes (T1D) has now been largely determined, so now we can compare these findings with emerging genetic knowledge of disorders and phenotypes that have been negatively or positively associated with T1D historically. Here, we assessed the role in T1D of variants previously reported to be associated with atopic diseases and epithelial barrier function, profilaggrin (), and those that affect the expression levels of the proinflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±, interleukin (IL)-1Î², interferon (IFN)Î³ and IL-18.We genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): - 105/rs28665122 in SELS or SEPS1 (selenoprotein), three single nucleotide polymorphisms in IL18 (-105/rs360717, + 183/rs5744292 and + 1467/rs574456) and R501X/rs61816761 in FLG, the major locus associated with atopic dermatitis and predisposing to asthma, in a minimum of 6743 T1D cases and 7864 controls.No evidence of T1D association was found for any of the SNPs we genotyped at FLG, SELS or IL18 (p â¥ 0.03), nor with haplotypes of IL18 (p = 0.82). Review of previous T1D genome-wide association results revealed that four (human leucocyte antigen (HLA), gasdermin B/ORM1 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)-like/gasdermin B/, GSDMB/ORMDL3/GSDMA and IL2RB) of ten loci recently reported to be associated with asthma were associated with T1D (pâ©½0.005).These results show that there are shared genetic associations for atopy-related traits and T1D, and this might help in the future to understand the mechanisms, pathways and environmental factors that underpin the rapid rise in incidence of both disorders in children.

  <!--   <p>IKZF1 encoding Ikaros, an essential regulator of lymphopoiesis and immune homeostasis, has been implicated in the development of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (C-ALL). Because recent genome-wide association (GWA) studies have linked a region of the 3’-UTR of IKZF1 with C-ALL susceptibility, we tested whether IKZF1 is associated with the autoimmune disease type 1 diabetes.rs10272724 (T>C) near IKZF1 at 7p12 was genotyped in 8,333 individuals with type 1 diabetes, 9,947 control subjects, and 3,997 families of European ancestry. Association was tested using logistic regression in the case-control data and by the transmission disequilibrium test in the families. Expression data for IKZF1 by rs10272724 genotype were obtained using quantitative PCR of mRNA/cDNA generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 88 individuals, whereas expression data for five other neighboring genes were obtained from the online Genevar dataset.The minor allele of rs10272724 (C) was found to be protective from type 1 diabetes (odds ratio 0.87 [95% CI 0.83-0.91]; P = 1.1 Ã 10(-11)). rs10272724 was not correlated with levels of two transcripts of IKZF1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.The major susceptibility genotype for C-ALL confers protection from type 1 diabetes. Our finding strengthens the link between autoimmunity and lymphoid cancers. Further investigation is warranted for the genetic effect marked by rs10272724, its impact on IKZF1, and the role of Ikaros and other family members, Ailios (IKZF3) and Eos (IKZF4), in autoimmunity.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>Using variants from the 1000 Genomes Project pilot European CEU dataset and data from additional resequencing studies, we densely genotyped 183 non-HLA risk loci previously associated with immune-mediated diseases in 12,041 individuals with celiac disease (cases) and 12,228 controls. We identified 13 new celiac disease risk loci reaching genome-wide significance, bringing the number of known loci (including the HLA locus) to 40. We found multiple independent association signals at over one-third of these loci, a finding that is attributable to a combination of common, low-frequency and rare genetic variants. Compared to previously available data such as those from HapMap3, our dense genotyping in a large sample collection provided a higher resolution of the pattern of linkage disequilibrium and suggested localization of many signals to finer scale regions. In particular, 29 of the 54 fine-mapped signals seemed to be localized to single genes and, in some instances, to gene regulatory elements. Altogether, we define the complex genetic architecture of the risk regions of and refine the risk signals for celiac disease, providing the next step toward uncovering the causal mechanisms of the disease.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>IFIH1 (interferon induced with helicase C domain 1), also known as MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5), is one of a family of intracellular proteins known to recognise viral RNA and mediate the innate immune response. IFIH1 is causal in type 1 diabetes based on the protective associations of four rare variants, where the derived alleles are predicted to reduce gene expression or function. Originally, however, T1D protection was mapped to the common IFIH1 nsSNP, rs1990760 or Thr946Ala. This common amino acid substitution does not cause a loss of function and evidence suggests the protective allele, Ala(946), may mark a haplotype with reduced expression of IFIH1 in line with the protection conferred by the four rare loss of function alleles. We have performed allele specific expression analysis that supports this hypothesis: the T1D protective haplotype correlates with reduced IFIH1 transcription in interferon-Î² stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (overall pâ=â0.012). In addition, we have used multiflow cytometry analysis and quantitative PCR assays to prove reduced expression of IFIH1 in individuals heterozygous for three of the T1D-associated rare alleles: a premature stop codon, rs35744605 (Glu627X) and predicted splice variants, rs35337543 (IVS8+1) and rs35732034 (IVS14+1). We also show that the nsSNP, Ile923V, does not alter pre-mRNA levels of IFIH1. These results confirm and extend the new autoimmune disease pathway of reduced IFIH1 expression and protein function protecting from T1D.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>Combined analyses of gene networks and DNA sequence variation can provide new insights into the aetiology of common diseases that may not be apparent from genome-wide association studies alone. Recent advances in rat genomics are facilitating systems-genetics approaches. Here we report the use of integrated genome-wide approaches across seven rat tissues to identify gene networks and the loci underlying their regulation. We defined an interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7)-driven inflammatory network (IDIN) enriched for viral response genes, which represents a molecular biomarker for macrophages and which was regulated in multiple tissues by a locus on rat chromosome 15q25. We show that Epstein-Barr virus induced gene 2 (Ebi2, also known as Gpr183), which lies at this locus and controls B lymphocyte migration, is expressed in macrophages and regulates the IDIN. The human orthologous locus on chromosome 13q32 controlled the human equivalent of the IDIN, which was conserved in monocytes. IDIN genes were more likely to associate with susceptibility to type 1 diabetes (T1D)-a macrophage-associated autoimmune disease-than randomly selected immune response genes (P = 8.85âÃâ10(-6)). The human locus controlling the IDIN was associated with the risk of T1D at single nucleotide polymorphism rs9585056 (P = 7.0âÃâ10(-10); odds ratio, 1.15), which was one of five single nucleotide polymorphisms in this region associated with EBI2 (GPR183) expression. These data implicate IRF7 network genes and their regulatory locus in the pathogenesis of T1D.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>Genome-wide association (GWA) studies to map common disease susceptibility loci have been hugely successful, with over 300 reproducibly associated loci reported to date. However, these studies have not yet provided convincing evidence for any susceptibility locus subject to parent-of-origin effects. Using imputation to extend existing GWA datasets, we have obtained robust evidence at rs941576 for paternally inherited risk of type 1 diabetes (T1D; ratio of allelic effects for paternal versus maternal transmissions = 0.75; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.71-0.79). This marker is in the imprinted region of chromosome 14q32.2, which contains the functional candidate gene DLK1. Our meta-analysis also provided support at genome-wide significance for a T1D locus at chromosome 19p13.2. The highest association was at marker rs2304256 (odds ratio (OR) = 0.86; 95%CI = 0.82-0.90) in the TYK2 gene, which has previously been associated with systemic lupus erythematosus and multiple sclerosis.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>Because angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity is implicated widely in biological systems, we aimed to identify its novel quantitative trait loci for the purposes of understanding ACE activity regulation and pharmacogenetics relating to ACE inhibitor (ACEI). We performed a two-stage genome-wide association study: (1) from 400 young-onset hypertension (YOH) subjects and (2) a confirmation study with an additional 623 YOH subjects. In the first stage, eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the ACE structural gene and one SNP of ABO genes were significantly associated with ACE activity. SNP rs4343 in exon17 near the well-known insertion/deletion polymorphism had the strongest association. We confirmed in the second stage that three SNPs: rs4343 in ACE gene (P=3.0 x 10⁻²⁵), rs495828 (P=3.5 x 10⁻⁸) and rs8176746 (P=9.3 x 10⁻⁵) in ABO gene were significantly associated with ACE activity. We further replicated the association between ABO genotype/blood types and ACE activity in an independent YOH family study (428 hypertension pedigrees), and showed a potential differential blood pressure response to ACEI in subjects with varied numbers of ACE-activity-raising alleles. These findings may broaden our understanding of the mechanisms controlling ACE activity and advance our pharmacogenetic knowledge on ACEI.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>Copy number variants (CNVs) account for a major proportion of human genetic polymorphism and have been predicted to have an important role in genetic susceptibility to common disease. To address this we undertook a large, direct genome-wide study of association between CNVs and eight common human diseases. Using a purpose-designed array we typed approximately 19,000 individuals into distinct copy-number classes at 3,432 polymorphic CNVs, including an estimated approximately 50% of all common CNVs larger than 500 base pairs. We identified several biological artefacts that lead to false-positive associations, including systematic CNV differences between DNAs derived from blood and cell lines. Association testing and follow-up re
 plication analyses confirmed three loci where CNVs were associated with disease-IRGM for Crohn’s disease, HLA for Crohn’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes, and TSPAN8 for type 2 diabetes-although in each case the locus had previously been identified in single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based studies, reflecting our observation that most common CNVs that are well-typed on our array are well tagged by SNPs and so have been indirectly explored through SNP studies. We conclude that common CNVs that can be typed on existing platforms are unlikely to contribute greatly to the genetic basis of common human diseases.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>Elevated blood pressure is a common, heritable cause of cardiovascular disease worldwide. To date, identification of common genetic variants influencing blood pressure has proven challenging. We tested 2.5 million genotyped and imputed SNPs for association with systolic and diastolic blood pressure in 34,433 subjects of European ancestry from the Global BPgen consortium and followed up findings with direct genotyping (N ≤ 71,225 European ancestry, N ≤ 12,889 Indian Asian ancestry) and in silico comparison (CHARGE consortium, N = 29,136). We identified association between systolic or diastolic blood pressure and common variants in eight regions near the CYP17A1 (P = 7 × 10(-24)), CYP1A2 (P = 1 × 10(-23)), FGF5 (P = 1 × 10(-21)), SH2B3 (P = 3 × 10(-18)), MTHFR (P = 2 × 10(-13)), c10orf107 (P = 1 × 10(-9)), ZNF652 (P = 5 × 10(-9)) and PLCD3 (P = 1 × 10(-8)) genes. All variants associated with continuous blood pressure were associated with dichotomous hypertension. These associations between common variants and blood pressure and hypertension offer mechanistic insights into the regulation of blood pressure and may point to novel targets for interventions to prevent cardiovascular disease.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>Common variants at only two loci, FTO and MC4R, have been reproducibly associated with body mass index (BMI) in humans. To identify additional loci, we conducted meta-analysis of 15 genome-wide association studies for BMI (n > 32,000) and followed up top signals in 14 additional cohorts (n > 59,000). We strongly confirm FTO and MC4R and identify six additional loci (P < 5 x 10(-8)): TMEM18, KCTD15, GNPDA2, SH2B1, MTCH2 and NEGR1 (where a 45-kb deletion polymorphism is a candidate causal variant). Several of the likely causal genes are highly expressed or known to act in the central nervous system (CNS), emphasizing, as in rare monogenic forms of obesity, the role of the CNS in predisposition to obesity.</p> -->

  <!--   <p><title>Author Summary</title> <p>Elevated serum uric acid levels cause gout and are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The regulation of serum uric acid levels is under a strong genetic control. This study describes the first meta-analysis of genome-wide association scans from 14 studies totalling 28,141 participants of European descent. We show that common DNA variants at nine different loci are associated with uric acid concentrations, five of which are novel. These variants are located within the genes coding for organic anion transporter 4 (<italic>SLC22A11</italic>), monocarboxylic acid transporter 9 (<italic>SLC16A9</italic>), glucokinase regulatory protein (<italic>GCKR</italic>), Carmil (<italic>LRRC16A</italic>), and near PDZ domain-containing 1 (<italic>PDZK1</italic>). Gender-specific effects are shown for variants within the recently identified genes coding for glucose transporter 9 (<italic>SLC2A9</italic>) and the ATP-binding cassette transporter (<italic>ABCG2</italic>). Based on screening of 163 metabolites, we show an association of one of the identified variants within <italic>SLC16A9</italic> with DL-carnitine and propionyl-L-carnitine. Moreover, DL-carnitine and propionyl-L-carnitine were strongly correlated with serum UA levels, forming a triangle between SNP, metabolites and UA levels. Taken together, these associations highlight pathways that are important in the regulation of serum uric acid levels and point toward novel potential targets for pharmacological intervention to prevent or treat hyperuricemia.</p></p> -->

  <!--   <p>To identify genetic loci influencing central obesity and fat distribution, we performed a meta-analysis of 16 genome-wide association studies (GWAS, N = 38,580) informative for adult waist circumference (WC) and waist-hip ratio (WHR). We selected 26 SNPs for follow-up, for which the evidence of association with measures of central adiposity (WC and/or WHR) was strong and disproportionate to that for overall adiposity or height. Follow-up studies in a maximum of 70,689 individuals identified two loci strongly associated with measures of central adiposity; these map near TFAP2B (WC, P = 1.9x10(-11)) and MSRA (WC, P = 8.9x10(-9)). A third locus, near LYPLAL1, was associated with WHR in women only (P = 2.6x10(-8)). The variants near TFAP2B appear to influence central adiposity through an effect on overall obesity/fat-mass, whereas LYPLAL1 displays a strong female-only association with fat distribution. By focusing on anthropometric measures of central obesity and fat distribution, we have identified three loci implicated in the regulation of human adiposity.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>WNK1–a serine/threonine kinase involved in electrolyte homeostasis and blood pressure (BP) control–is an excellent candidate gene for essential hypertension (EH). We and others have previously reported association between WNK1 and BP variation. Using tag SNPs (tSNPs) that capture 100% of common WNK1 variation in HapMap, we aimed to replicate our findings with BP and to test for association with phenotypes relating to WNK1 function in the British Genetics of Hypertension (BRIGHT) study case-control resource (1700 hypertensive cases and 1700 normotensive controls). We found multiple variants to be associated with systolic blood pressure, SBP (7/28 tSNPs min-p = 0.0005), diastolic blood pressure, DBP (7/28 tSNPs min-p = 0.002) and 24 hour urinary potassium excretion (10/28 tSNPs min-p = 0.0004). Associations with SBP and urine potassium remained significant after correction for multiple testing (p = 0.02 and p = 0.01 respectively). The major allele (A) of rs765250, located in intron 1, demonstrated the strongest evidence for association with SBP, effect size 3.14 mmHg (95%CI:1.23-4.9), DBP 1.9 mmHg (95%CI:0.7-3.2) and hypertension, odds ratio (OR: 1.3 [95%CI: 1.0-1.7]).We genotyped this variant in six independent populations (n = 14,451) and replicated the association between rs765250 and SBP in a meta-analysis (p = 7 x 10(-3), combined with BRIGHT data-set p = 2 x 10(-4), n = 17,851). The associations of WNK1 with DBP and EH were not confirmed. Haplotype analysis revealed striking associations with hypertension and BP variation (global permutation p<10(-7)). We identified several common haplotypes to be associated with increased BP and multiple low frequency haplotypes significantly associated with lower BP (>10 mmHg reduction) and risk for hypertension (OR<0.60). Our data indicates that multiple rare and common WNK1 variants contribute to BP variation and hypertension, and provide compelling evidence to initiate further genetic and functional studies to explore the role of WNK1 in BP regulation and EH.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>To identify loci affecting the electrocardiographic QT interval, a measure of cardiac repolarisation associated with risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, we conducted a meta-analysis of three genome-wide association studies (GWAS) including 3,558 subjects from the TwinsUK and BRIGHT cohorts in the UK and the DCCT/EDIC cohort from North America. Five loci were significantly associated with QT interval at P<1x10(-6). To validate these findings we performed an in silico comparison with data from two QT consortia: QTSCD (n = 15,842) and QTGEN (n = 13,685). Analysis confirmed the association between common variants near NOS1AP (P = 1.4x10(-83)) and the phospholamban (PLN) gene (P = 1.9x10(-29)). The most associated SNP near NOS1AP (rs12143842) explains 0.82% variance; the SNP near PLN (rs11153730) explains 0.74% variance of QT interval duration. We found no evidence for interaction between these two SNPs (P = 0.99). PLN is a key regulator of cardiac diastolic function and is involved in regulating intracellular calcium cycling, it has only recently been identified as a susceptibility locus for QT interval. These data offer further mechanistic insights into genetic influence on the QT interval which may predispose to life threatening arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>Many common diseases are accompanied by disturbances in biochemical traits. Identifying the genetic determinants could provide novel insights into disease mechanisms and reveal avenues for developing new therapies. Here we report a genome-wide association analysis for commonly measured serum and urine biochemical traits. As part of the WTCCC, 500,000 SNPs genomewide were genotyped in 1955 hypertensive individuals characterized for 25 serum and urine biochemical traits. For each trait we assessed association with individual SNPs, adjusting for age, sex and BMI. Lipid measurements were further examined in a meta-analysis of genome-wide data from a type 2 diabetes scan. The most promising associations were examined in two epidemiological cohorts. We discovered association between serum urate and SLC2A9, a glucose transporter (p = 2Ã10-15) and confirmed this in two independent cohorts, GRAPHIC study (p = 9Ã10-15), TwinsUK (p = 8Ã10-19). The odds ratio for hyperuricaemia (defined as urate > 0.4mMol/l) is 1.89 (95% CI = 1.36-2.61) per copy of common allele. We also replicated many genes previously associated with serum lipids and found novel association between LDL levels and SNPs close to genes encoding PSRC1 and CELSR2 (p = 1Ã10-7). The common allele was associated with a 6% increase in non-fasting serum LDL. This region showed increased association in the meta-analysis (p = 4Ã10-14) and this finding provides a potential biological mechanism for the recent association of this same allele of the same SNP with increased risk of coronary disease.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>OBJECTIVES: Glutathione S-transferases are involved in defences against oxidative stress. We have recently demonstrated reduced expression of glutathione S-transferase mu type 1 (Gstm1) in a rat model of hypertension. Here, we examine the association between GSTM variants and hypertension in human. METHODS: We screened 83 patients with hypertension and 46 controls for single nucleotide polymorphisms in GSTM genes by TaqMan single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping assays and DNA sequencing. We then genotyped 753 trios from the Medical Research Council British Genetics of Hypertension Study transmission disequilibrium test cohort for 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms and the GSTM1 deletion and examined renal GSTM expression in a cohort of 27 hypertensive and 18 normotensive subjects. Finally, we attempted to replicate our findings in 1675 cases and 1654 controls from the Medical Research Council British Genetics of Hypertension Study case-control cohort. RESULTS: We identified two major linkage disequilibrium blocks including GSTM4/GSTM2 and GSTM5/GSTM3 separated by the GSTM1 gene. In the British Genetics of Hypertension transmission disequilibrium test resource, a single nucleotide polymorphism in the 3’ region of GSTM5 (rs11807) was found to be associated with hypertension (P = 0.01) with the T-allele being over-transmitted to hypertensive offspring. GSTM5 mRNA expression was found to be reduced in kidney tissue of subjects homozygous for the T-allele of rs11807 as compared to C-allele homozygous and CT heterozygous subjects (P = 0.02). Nevertheless, rs11807 was not associated with hypertension in the British Genetics of Hypertension case-control cohort (P = 0.61). CONCLUSION: Our studies do not provide an evidence of an association of GSTM gene variants with hypertension in humans. They, however, illustrate the essential role of replication of initial results in a second cohort.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>To identify common variants influencing body mass index (BMI), we analyzed genome-wide association data from 16,876 individuals of European descent. After previously reported variants in FTO, the strongest association signal (rs17782313, P = 2.9 x 10(-6)) mapped 188 kb downstream of MC4R (melanocortin-4 receptor), mutations of which are the leading cause of monogenic severe childhood-onset obesity. We confirmed the BMI association in 60,352 adults (per-allele effect = 0.05 Z-score units; P = 2.8 x 10(-15)) and 5,988 children aged 7-11 (0.13 Z-score units; P = 1.5 x 10(-8)). In case-control analyses (n = 10,583), the odds for severe childhood obesity reached 1.30 (P = 8.0 x 10(-11)). Furthermore, we observed overtransmission of the risk allele to obese offspring in 660 families (P (pedigree disequilibrium test average; PDT-avg) = 2.4 x 10(-4)). The SNP location and patterns of phenotypic associations are consistent with effects mediated through altered MC4R function. Our findings establish that common variants near MC4R influence fat mass, weight and obesity risk at the population level and reinforce the need for large-scale data integration to identify variants influencing continuous biomedical traits.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>Adult height is a model polygenic trait, but there has been limited success in identifying the genes underlying its normal variation. To identify genetic variants influencing adult human height, we used genome-wide association data from 13,665 individuals and genotyped 39 variants in an additional 16,482 samples. We identified 20 variants associated with adult height (P < 5 x 10(-7), with 10 reaching P < 1 x 10(-10)). Combined, the 20 SNPs explain approximately 3% of height variation, with a approximately 5 cm difference between the 6.2% of people with 17 or fewer ’tall’ alleles compared to the 5.5% with 27 or more ’tall’ alleles. The loci we identified implicate genes in Hedgehog signaling (IHH, HHIP, PTCH1), extracellular matrix (EFEMP1, ADAMTSL3, ACAN) and cancer (CDK6, HMGA2, DLEU7) pathways, and provide new insights into human growth and developmental processes. Finally, our results provide insights into the genetic architecture of a classic quantitative trait.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) are being actively and extensively used to examine the expression of specific genes and genome-wide expression profiles, including allele specific expression assays. However, it has recently been shown that approximately 10% of human genes exhibit random patterns of monoallelic expression within single clones of LCLs. Consequently allelic imbalance studies could be significantly compromised if bulk populations of donor cells are clonal, or near clonal. Here, using X chromosome inactivation as a readout, we confirm and quantify widespread near monoclonality in two independent sets of cell lines. Consequently, we recommend where possible the use of bulk, non cell line, ex vivo cells for allele specific expression assays. </p> -->

  <!--   <p>BACKGROUND: Serum uric acid levels in humans are influenced by diet, cellular breakdown, and renal elimination, and correlate with blood pressure, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, gout, and cardiovascular disease. Recent genome-wide association scans have found common genetic variants of SLC2A9 to be associated with increased serum urate level and gout. The SLC2A9 gene encodes a facilitative glucose transporter, and it has two splice variants that are highly expressed in the proximal nephron, a key site for urate handling in the kidney. We investigated whether SLC2A9 is a functional urate transporter that contributes to the longstanding association between urate and blood pressure in man. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We expressed both SLC2A9 splice variants in Xenopus laevis oocytes and found both isoforms mediate rapid urate fluxes at concentration ranges similar to physiological serum levels (200-500 muM). Because SLC2A9 is a known facilitative glucose transporter, we also tested whether glucose or fructose influenced urate transport. We found that urate is transported by SLC2A9 at rates 45- to 60-fold faster than glucose, and demonstrated that SLC2A9-mediated urate transport is facilitated by glucose and, to a lesser extent, fructose. In addition, transport is inhibited by the uricosuric benzbromarone in a dose-dependent manner (Ki = 27 muM). Furthermore, we found urate uptake was at least 2-fold greater in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells overexpressing SLC2A9 splice variants than nontransfected kidney cells. To confirm that our findings were due to SLC2A9, and not another urate transporter, we showed that urate transport was diminished by SLC2A9-targeted siRNA in a second mammalian cell line. In a cohort of men we showed that genetic variants of SLC2A9 are associated with reduced urinary urate clearance, which fits with common variation at SLC2A9 leading to increased serum urate. We found no evidence of association with hypertension (odds ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9 to 1.05, p > 0.33) by meta-analysis of an SLC2A9 variant in six case-control studies including 11,897 participants. In a separate meta-analysis of four population studies including 11,629 participants we found no association of SLC2A9 with systolic (effect size -0.12 mm Hg, 95% CI -0.68 to 0.43, p = 0.664) or diastolic blood pressure (effect size -0.03 mm Hg, 95% CI -0.39 to 0.31, p = 0.82). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that SLC2A9 splice variants act as high-capacity urate transporters and is one of the first functional characterisations of findings from genome-wide association scans. We did not find an association of the SLC2A9 gene with blood pressure in this study. Our findings suggest potential pathogenic mechanisms that could offer a new drug target for gout.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>Large-scale genetic association studies are now widely conducted using SNPs selected from the International HapMap Project or provided on commercial "whole genome" chips. As only a subset of human genetic variation has been identified, it is unknown what proportion of the total genetic variation can be captured in this way, although recent genome-wide estimates of SNP capture rates have been encouraging. We estimated the expected gene-centric information capture for whole-genome chips using sequence data from 306 inflammatory/cardiovascular genes and found SNP capture rates notably lower than previous genome-wide estimates. Further investigation indicates that a major explanation for these lower capture rates is the aggregation of particular sequence features that influence both linkage disequilibrium and the amenability of SNPs for genotyping within the broad class of inflammatory/ cardiovascular genes. This suggests that the power of genetic association studies in some complex traits will depend not only upon established factors, such as allele frequency and penetrance, but may also be influenced by the distribution of sequence features in the class of genes expected to underlie the disease of interest.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>Inositol polyphosphate phosphatase-like 1 (INPPL1, SHIP2) is a negative regulator of insulin signalling and was previously found to be associated with hypertension, obesity and type 2 diabetes in a cohort of British diabetic families presenting features of the metabolic syndrome. In particular, a haplotype of three genetic polymorphisms (rs2276047, rs9886 and an insertion/deletion polymorphism in intron 1) was found to be strongly associated with increased susceptibility to hypertension. To assess if INPPL1 variants play a direct role in the development of essential hypertension, we genotyped the three previously associated INPPL1 polymorphisms in a cohort of 712 severely hypertensive TDT families from the BRIGHT study. We found no evidence of significant association between hypertension and any of the three INPPL1 polymorphisms or haplotypes (p > 0.1). These results suggest that INPPL1 variants may be involved in mechanisms causing hypertension specifically in the context of the metabolic syndrome.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) primary genome-wide association (GWA) scan on seven diseases, including the multifactorial autoimmune disease type 1 diabetes (T1D), shows associations at P < 5 x 10(-7) between T1D and six chromosome regions: 12q24, 12q13, 16p13, 18p11, 12p13 and 4q27. Here, we attempted to validate these and six other top findings in 4,000 individuals with T1D, 5,000 controls and 2,997 family trios independent of the WTCCC study. We confirmed unequivocally the associations of 12q24, 12q13, 16p13 and 18p11 (P(follow-up) </= 1.35 x 10(-9); P(overall) </= 1.15 x 10(-14)), leaving eight regions with small effects or false-positive associations. We also obtained evidence for chromosome 18q22 (P(overall) = 1.38 x 10(-8)) from a GWA study of nonsynonymous SNPs. Several regions, including 18q22 and 18p11, showed association with autoimmune thyroid disease. This study increases the number of T1D loci with compelling evidence from six to at least ten.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>There is increasing evidence that genome-wide association (GWA) studies represent a powerful approach to the identification of genes involved in common human diseases. We describe a joint GWA study (using the Affymetrix GeneChip 500K Mapping Array Set) undertaken in the British population, which has examined approximately 2,000 individuals for each of 7 major diseases and a shared set of approximately 3,000 controls. Case-control comparisons identified 24 independent association signals at P < 5 x 10(-7): 1 in bipolar disorder, 1 in coronary artery disease, 9 in Crohn’s disease, 3 in rheumatoid arthritis, 7 in type 1 diabetes and 3 in type 2 diabetes. On the basis of prior findings and replication studies thus-far completed, almost all of these signals reflect genuine susceptibility effects. We observed association at many previously identified loci, and found compelling evidence that some loci confer risk for more than one of the diseases studied. Across all diseases, we identified a large number of further signals (including 58 loci with single-point P values between 10(-5) and 5 x 10(-7)) likely to yield additional susceptibility loci. The importance of appropriately large samples was confirmed by the modest effect sizes observed at most loci identified. This study thus represents a thorough validation of the GWA approach. It has also demonstrated that careful use of a shared control group represents a safe and effective approach to GWA analyses of multiple disease phenotypes; has generated a genome-wide genotype database for future studies of common diseases in the British population; and shown that, provided individuals with non-European ancestry are excluded, the extent of population stratification in the British population is generally modest. Our findings offer new avenues for exploring the pathophysiology of these important disorders. We anticipate that our data, results and software, which will be widely available to other investigators, will provide a powerful resource for human genetics research.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>Summary When conducting genetic studies for complex traits, large samples are commonly required to detect any of the number of genes with relatively low effect thought to underly such traits. This is because, in contrast to monogenic diseases, complex traits typically result from a number of different genetic pathways (genetic heterogeneity) and any sample is likely to contain a considerable fraction of sporadic cases (phenocopies). Such samples are time-consuming and costly to recruit and analyse. Methods which might be used to decrease sample size include attempting to select families, with the aim of reducing genetic heterogeneity or phenocopy rate within the sample. Selecting cases with positive family history of disease should reduce the phenocopy rate, and this strategy has been employed in linkage studies of complex disease, although evaluations of such a strategy have been equivocal. This paper shows how identity by descent (IBD) distributions may be calculated for affected relative pairs recruited conditional on the affection status of a third relative. These distributions are then used to calculate expected power in affected sib and half-sib linkage studies when recruitment is conditional on family history of disease. We consider the proxy conditions of recruitment conditional on disease in an affected parent or third sibling with single-locus and additive multilocus genetic models. We show that while such selection strategies can reduce power if disease risk alleles are common and environmental heterogeneity low, under models more likely to underly common complex diseases power will generally be increased, and that this effect is greater as more loci are involved. Though the proxy cases studied are more extreme than a general strategy of asking potential recruits whether they have any family history of disease, these results suggest that conditional recruitment is more generally useful than previous studies have suggested.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>Selective genotyping is used to increase efficiency in genetic association studies of quantitative traits by genotyping only those individuals who deviate from the population mean. However, selection distorts the conditional distribution of the trait given genotype, and such data sets are usually analyzed using case-control methods, quantitative analysis within selected groups, or a combination of both. We show that Hotelling’s T(2) test, recently proposed for association studies of one or several tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms in a prospective (i.e., trait given genotype) design, can also be applied to the retrospective (i.e., genotype given trait) selective-genotyping design, and we use simulation to demonstrate its improved power over existing methods.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>Human hypertension arises from a combination of genetic factors and lifestyle influences. With cardiovascular disease set to become the number 1 cause of death worldwide, it is important to understand the etiologic mechanisms for hypertension, because these might provide new routes to improved treatment. The British Genetics of Hypertension Study has recently published a primary genome screen that identified 4 chromosomal regions of interest. We have now genotyped additional markers to confirm the most promising regions for follow-up studies. Thirty-four additional microsatellites were genotyped in our severely hypertensive affected sibling pair resource (now 1635 families with 2142 affected sibling pairs), leading to a substantial increase in information content in the regions of interest. We found increased support for linkage of chromosome 5q13 to human hypertension (multipoint logarithm of odds=2.50) with 3 adjacent markers yielding single point logarithm of odds scores of 3.22, 2.84, and 2.51. The placement of additional markers on 2q, 6q, and 9q diminished support for linkage in these regions. However, the addition of new data and families identified novel regions of interest on chromosomes 1q and 11q. The 3 positive markers in the chromosome 5 region were also genotyped in 712 distinct parent-offspring trios with the same severe phenotype to replicate linkage and association. Borderline support for replication was found (P=0.07). We found increased evidence for linkage and borderline-significant evidence for association for a hypertension susceptibility locus on chromosome 5q13 that is worthy of detailed fine mapping and assessment of candidate genes.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>It is well established that gene interactions influence common human diseases, but to date linkage studies have been constrained to searching for single genes across the genome. We applied a novel approach to uncover significant gene-gene interactions in a systematic two-dimensional (2D) genome scan of essential hypertension. The study cohort comprised 2076 affected sib-pairs and 66 affected half-sib-pairs from the BRItish Genetics of HyperTension study. Extensive simulations were used to establish significance thresholds in the context of 2D genome scans. Our analyses found significant and suggestive evidence for loci on chromosomes 5, 9, 11, 15, 16, and 19 that influence hypertension when gene-gene interactions are taken into account (5q13.1 and 11q22.1, two-locus lod score = 5.72; 5q13.1 and 19q12, two-locus lod score = 5.35; 9q22.3 and 15q12, two-locus lod score = 4.80; 16p12.3 and 16q23, two-locus lod score = 4.50). For each significant and suggestive pairwise interaction, the two-locus genetic model that best fitted the data was determined. Regions that were not detected using single-locus linkage analysis were identified in the 2D scan as contributing significant epistatic effects. This approach has discovered novel loci for hypertension and offers a unique potential to use existing data to uncover novel regions involved in complex human diseases.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>OBJECTIVES: Current evidence demonstrates that both genetic and environmental factors influence blood pressure. The sympathetic nervous system is a key player in blood pressure control and functional genetic variants of the beta-2 adrenergic receptor (B2AR) have been identified and implicated in the pathogenesis of hypertension. The present study aimed to determine the effects of common haplotypes of the B2AR gene upon blood pressure in the Caerphilly Prospective Study. DESIGN: Two thousand five hundred and twelve men (aged 45-59 years) participated in the study. We selected individuals in the upper (n = 347) and lower (n = 279) quintiles of the diastolic blood pressure distribution fixed at two time points [phase 2 (1984-88) or phase 3 (1989-93)] as cases and controls. METHODS: We analysed two functional polymorphisms (Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu) of B2AR and their haplotypes. RESULTS: We found a higher risk of hypertension in individuals homozygous for the Gln27 compared to those individuals homozygous for Glu27 [odds ratio (OR) = 1.94; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.34-2.81; P = 0.001]. Three haplotypes (Gly16Gln27, Gly16Glu27 and Arg16Gln27) were present in both quintile groups. Logistic regression analysis showed that haplotypes with a Gln27 allele (Gly16Gln27 and Arg16Gln27) conferred a significantly higher risk for hypertension than the Gly16Glu27 haplotype (OR = 1.55; 95% CI = 1.11-2.17, OR = 1.37; 95% CI = 1.04-1.81; P = 0.009 and P = 0.027, respectively). However, there was no evidence to support a statistically significant difference in odds ratios for the Gly16Gln27 and Arg16Gln27 haplotypes (P = 0.477), suggesting that it is the Gln27 allele alone, rather than any haplotype, which best explains the association. CONCLUSIONS: In a prospectively studied Caucasian male cohort, high diastolic blood pressure was associated with B2AR haplotypes containing the pro-downregulatory Gln27 variant.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>There is a lack of consistently linked loci influencing blood pressure and hypertension status, and this may be because of genetic or phenotypic heterogeneity. We hypothesize that stratification of subjects by response to antihypertensive drug groups could be used to stringently define subsets that will have reduced genetic and etiologic heterogeneity, by partitioning contrasting mechanisms of hypertension and, thus, enhancing gene finding. We investigated the British Genetics of Hypertension Study population, which is composed of 2142 severely hypertensive white affected sibling pairs. Nonresponse to antihypertensive therapy was defined as an on-treatment blood pressure of >140/90 mm Hg or a difference between prediagnosis and on-treatment blood pressure of <20 mm Hg. Of the nonresponders, there were 89 sibling pairs (AB) who were both on antihypertensive therapy that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockers, or beta-blockers), and 76 sibling pairs (CD) who were both on drugs that do not (calcium channel blockers or diuretics). Nonparametric linkage analysis carried out using markers from a 10-cM genome scan and additional "grid tightening" markers showed significant linkage in the AB group on chromosome 2p (logarithm of odds=4.84 at 90.68 Kosambi cM) and suggestive linkage for the CD group on chromosome 10q (logarithm of odds=2.83 at 125.96 Kosambi cM). The AB linkage locus attained genomewide significance after simulation using 10 000 replicates (P=0.005). This locus may contain a gene for the salt-sensitive form of hypertension and/or a pharmacogenetic locus affecting drug response. We have demonstrated for the first time identification of a significant locus by partitioning different pathways of hypertension using drug response.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>Mutations in the WNK1 gene cause Gordon’s syndrome, a rare Mendelian form of hypertension. We assessed whether common WNK1 variants might also contribute to essential hypertension (EH), a multifactorial disorder affecting > 25% of the adult population worldwide. A panel of 19 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning the gene was selected from public databases and was genotyped in 100 white European families to determine the pattern of linkage disequilibrium, haplotype structure and tagging SNPs for the WNK1 locus. Eight tagging SNPs were identified with 90% power to predict common WNK1 haplotypes and SNPs. Family-based association tests were used to test for association with EH and severity of hypertension in 712 severely hypertensive families from the MRC British Genetics of Hypertension study resource. No association was found between WNK1 polymorphisms or haplotypes with hypertension; however, one SNP rs1468326, located 3 kb from the WNK1 promoter, was found to be nominally associated with severity of hypertension, with both systolic blood pressure (BP) (Z = +2.24, P = 0.025) and diastolic BP (Z = +1.99, P = 0.046). We also found nominal support for association of one common WNK1 haplotype with increased systolic BP (Z = +1.91, P = 0.053). This is the first study to perform haplotype association analysis of the WNK1 gene with EH. This finding of association between a SNP near the promoter region and the severity of hypertension suggests that increased expression of WNK1 might contribute to BP variability and susceptibility to EH similar to the mechanism of hypertension observed in Gordon’s syndrome.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>Leprosy is a chronic disease caused by infection with Mycobacterium leprae, which is manifested across a wide clinical spectrum. There is evidence that susceptibility both to leprosy per se and to the clinical type of leprosy is influenced by host genetic factors. This paper describes the application of an identity by descent regression search for genetic determinants of leprosy type among families from Karonga District, Northern Malawi. Suggestive evidence was found for linkage to leprosy type on chr 21q22 (P<0.001). The methodological implications of the approach and the findings are discussed.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>AIMS: To test the hypothesis that methadone is responsible for a greater increase in overdose deaths than heroin, and causes proportionally more overdose deaths than heroin at weekends. DESIGN AND SETTING: Multivariate analysis of 3961 death certificates mentioning heroin, morphine and/or methadone held on the Office for National Statistics drug-related poisoning mortality database from 1993 to 1998 in England and Wales. MEASUREMENTS: Percentage increase in deaths by year by drug, odds ratio (OR) of dying at the weekend from methadone-related overdose compared to dying from heroin/morphine overdose. FINDINGS: From 1993 to 1998, annual opiate overdose deaths increased from 378 to 909. There was a 24.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 22-28%) yearly increase in heroin deaths compared to 9.4% (95% CI 6-13%) for methadone only. This difference was significant (P < 0.001 by test of interaction) after adjustment for sex, age group, polydrug use, area of residence and underlying cause of death. The largest number of deaths occurred on Saturday (673). The OR of death from methadone overdose on Saturday and Sunday was 1.48 (95% CI 1.29-1.71) for methadone-only deaths compared to dying from heroin/morphine at the weekend after adjustment for other covariates, but the OR was not significant (1.09, 95% CI 0.95-1.25) if the weekend was defined as Friday and Saturday. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence that the threefold increase in deaths over time was due to methadone. There was equivocal support only for the hypothesis that there was an excess of deaths from methadone at weekends. Increased interventions to prevent overdose among injectors in England and Wales are long overdue.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>The relative recurrence risk ratio lambdaR (and particularly the sibling recurrence risk ratio, lambdaS) is often of interest to those wanting to quantify the genetic contribution towards risk of disease or to discriminate between different genetic models. However, estimating lambdaR for complex diseases for which genetic and environmental risk factors are both involved is not straightforward. Ignoring environmental factors may lead to inflated estimates of lambdaR. We present a marginal model which uses a copula function to model the association in cumulative incidence rates between pairs of relatives. This model is applicable to present-state data and allows estimation of risk of disease in a pair of relatives (and hence lambdaR), given measured environmental covariates. We apply the model to leprosy among sibling pairs from the Karonga district, Malawi. If risk factors are ignored, the apparent lambdaS in this population is over 3. Accounting for known nongenetic risk factors reduces it to just under 2.</p> -->

  <!--   <p>Leprosy is a chronic disease caused by infection with Mycobacterium leprae. Susceptibility to leprosy is influenced by both genetic and non-genetic factors and the disease is known to cluster in families. One measure of genetic effect is the relative recurrence risk ratio, lambdaR. Estimates of this parameter can be inflated if environmental risk factors which also cluster in families, such as household contact, are not properly accounted for. We present the results of fitting a cross ratio model that allows estimation of the odds ratio of disease conditional on disease or no disease in a given relative, given measured covariates. From this model we can predict fitted values for lambdaR that represent the familial risk not accounted for by other covariates including observed household contact. If all covariates could be measured, this would be the ’genetic relative risk ratio’. We find lambdaR > 1 for all relative pairs except grandparent-grandchild, and lambdaR > 2 for siblings. Though not in itself evidence for a strong genetic susceptibility to leprosy, this result is consistent with much other evidence which suggests susceptibility to leprosy is under the control of many factors, the strongest of which may be non-genetic, with host genetics playing a small but significant role.</p> -->
