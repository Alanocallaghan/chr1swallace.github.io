"801373","Journal article","01/10/2016",,"BACKGROUND: Interleukin-2 (IL-2) has an essential role in the expansion and function of CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs). Tregs reduce tissue damage by limiting the immune response following infection and regulate autoreactive CD4+ effector T cells (Teffs) to prevent autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes (T1D). Genetic susceptibility to T1D causes alterations in the IL-2 pathway, a finding that supports Tregs as a cellular therapeutic target. Aldesleukin (Proleukin; recombinant human IL-2), which is administered at high doses to activate the immune system in cancer immunotherapy, is now being repositioned to treat inflammatory and autoimmune disorders at lower doses by targeting Tregs. METHODS AND FINDINGS: To define the aldesleukin dose response for Tregs and to find doses that increase Tregs physiologically for treatment of T1D, a statistical and systematic approach was taken by analysing the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single doses of subcutaneous aldesleukin in the Adaptive Study of IL-2 Dose on Regulatory T Cells in Type 1 Diabetes (DILT1D), a single centre, non-randomised, open label, adaptive dose-finding trial with 40 adult participants with recently diagnosed T1D. The primary endpoint was the maximum percentage increase in Tregs (defined as CD3+CD4+CD25highCD127low) from the baseline frequency in each participant measured over the 7 d following treatment. There was an initial learning phase with five pairs of participants, each pair receiving one of five pre-assigned single doses from 0.04 × 106 to 1.5 × 106 IU/m2, in order to model the dose-response curve. Results from each participant were then incorporated into interim statistical modelling to target the two doses most likely to induce 10% and 20% increases in Treg frequencies. Primary analysis of the evaluable population (n = 39) found that the optimal doses of aldesleukin to induce 10% and 20% increases in Tregs were 0.101 × 106 IU/m2 (standard error [SE] = 0.078, 95% CI = -0.052, 0.254) and 0.497 × 106 IU/m2 (SE = 0.092, 95% CI = 0.316, 0.678), respectively. On analysis of secondary outcomes, using a highly sensitive IL-2 assay, the observed plasma concentrations of the drug at 90 min exceeded the hypothetical Treg-specific therapeutic window determined in vitro (0.015-0.24 IU/ml), even at the lowest doses (0.040 × 106 and 0.045 × 106 IU/m2) administered. A rapid decrease in Treg frequency in the circulation was observed at 90 min and at day 1, which was dose dependent (mean decrease 11.6%, SE = 2.3%, range 10.0%-48.2%, n = 37), rebounding at day 2 and increasing to frequencies above baseline over 7 d. Teffs, natural killer cells, and eosinophils also responded, with their frequencies rapidly and dose-dependently decreased in the blood, then returning to, or exceeding, pretreatment levels. Furthermore, there was a dose-dependent down modulation of one of the two signalling subunits of the IL-2 receptor, the β chain (CD122) (mean decrease = 58.0%, SE = 2.8%, range 9.8%-85.5%, n = 33), on Tregs and a reduction in their sensitivity to aldesleukin at 90 min and day 1 and 2 post-treatment. Due to blood volume requirements as well as ethical and practical considerations, the study was limited to adults and to analysis of peripheral blood only. CONCLUSIONS: The DILT1D trial results, most notably the early altered trafficking and desensitisation of Tregs induced by a single ultra-low dose of aldesleukin that resolves within 2-3 d, inform the design of the next trial to determine a repeat dosing regimen aimed at establishing a steady-state Treg frequency increase of 20%-50%, with the eventual goal of preventing T1D.

"801373","Journal article","01/10/2016",,"$\textbf{Background}$
Interleukin-2 (IL-2) has an essential role in the expansion and function of CD4$^+$ regulatory T cells (Tregs). Tregs reduce tissue damage by limiting the immune response following infection and regulate autoreactive CD4$^+$ effector T cells (Teffs) to prevent autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes (T1D). Genetic susceptibility to T1D causes alterations in the IL-2 pathway, a finding that supports Tregs as a cellular therapeutic target. Aldesleukin (Proleukin; recombinant human IL-2), which is administered at high doses to activate the immune system in cancer immunotherapy, is now being repositioned to treat inflammatory and autoimmune disorders at lower doses by targeting Tregs.

$\textbf{Methods and Findings}$
To define the aldesleukin dose response for Tregs and to find doses that increase Tregs physiologically for treatment of T1D, a statistical and systematic approach was taken by analysing the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single doses of subcutaneous aldesleukin in the Adaptive Study of IL-2 Dose on Regulatory T Cells in Type 1 Diabetes (DILT1D), a single centre, non-randomised, open label, adaptive dose-finding trial with 40 adult participants with recently diagnosed T1D. The primary endpoint was the maximum percentage increase in Tregs (defined as CD3$^+$ CD4$^+$ CD25$^{high}$CD127$^{low}$) from the baseline frequency in each participant measured over the 7 d following treatment. There was an initial learning phase with five pairs of participants, each pair receiving one of five preassigned single doses from 0.04 × 10$^6$ to 1.5 × 10$^6$ IU/m$^2$ , in order to model the doseresponse curve. Results from each participant were then incorporated into interim statistical modelling to target the two doses most likely to induce 10% and 20% increases in Treg frequencies. Primary analysis of the evaluable population ($n$ = 39) found that the optimal doses of aldesleukin to induce 10% and 20% increases in Tregs were 0.101 × 10$^6$ IU/m$^2$ (standard error [SE] = 0.078, 95% CI = −0.052, 0.254) and 0.497 × 10$^6$ IU/m$^2$ (SE = 0.092, 95% CI = 0.316, 0.678), respectively. On analysis of secondary outcomes, using a highly sensitive IL-2 assay, the observed plasma concentrations of the drug at 90 min exceeded the hypothetical Treg-specific therapeutic window determined in vitro (0.015–0.24 IU/ml), even at the lowest doses (0.040 × 10$^6$ and 0.045 × 10$^6$ IU/m$^2$ ) administered. A rapid decrease in Treg frequency in the circulation was observed at 90 min and at day 1, which was dose dependent (mean decrease 11.6%, SE = 2.3%, range 10.0%–48.2%, $n$ = 37), rebounding at day 2 and increasing to frequencies above baseline over 7 d. Teffs, natural killer cells, and eosinophils also responded, with their frequencies rapidly and dose-dependently decreased in the blood, then returning to, or exceeding, pretreatment levels. Furthermore, there was a dose-dependent down modulation of one of the two signalling subunits of the IL-2 receptor, the $\beta$ chain (CD122) (mean decrease = 58.0%, SE = 2.8%, range 9.8%–85.5%, $n$ = 33), on Tregs and a reduction in their sensitivity to aldesleukin at 90 min and day 1 and 2 post-treatment. Due to blood volume requirements as well as ethical and practical considerations, the study was limited to adults and to analysis of peripheral blood only.

$\textbf{Conclusions}$
The DILT1D trial results, most notably the early altered trafficking and desensitisation of Tregs induced by a single ultra-low dose of aldesleukin that resolves within 2–3 d, inform the design of the next trial to determine a repeat dosing regimen aimed at establishing a steady-state Treg frequency increase of 20%–50%, with the eventual goal of preventing T1D.

"726995","Journal article","30/11/2015",,"Genome-wide association studies have been tremendously successful in identifying genetic variants associated with complex diseases. The majority of association signals are intergenic and evidence is accumulating that a high proportion of signals lie in enhancer regions. We use Capture Hi-C to investigate, for the first time, the interactions between associated variants for four autoimmune diseases and their functional targets in B- and T-cell lines. Here we report numerous looping interactions and provide evidence that only a minority of interactions are common to both B- and T-cell lines, suggesting interactions may be highly cell-type specific; some disease-associated SNPs do not interact with the nearest gene but with more compelling candidate genes (for example, FOXO1, AZI2) often situated several megabases away; and finally, regions associated with different autoimmune diseases interact with each other and the same promoter suggesting common autoimmune gene targets (for example, PTPRC, DEXI and ZFP36L1).",,"",,,"Martin P, Mcgovern A, Orozco G, Duffus K, Yarwood A, Schoenfelder S, Cooper NJ, Barton A, Wallace C, Fraser P",,"",,"10.1038/ncomms10069",,"",,,"pubmed:26616563",,,,,,"Nature communications","0604 Genetics, 1107 Immunology, Basic Science, Human Genome, Autoimmune Disease, Genetics, Biotechnology, 2.1 Biological and endogenous factors",,,,,,,,,"10069",,,,"2015-11-30","Published",,,,,,,"2.458923",,"Capture Hi-C reveals novel candidate genes and complex long-range interactions with related autoimmune risk loci.","Journal Article","6",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1","https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/266078","Yes","Live","Unknown","26616563","Dimensions for Universities","Nature Communications","SJR"

IL-2 responsiveness, measured by STAT5a phosphorylation, was a very stable phenotype within individuals but exhibited considerable interindividual variation and was influenced by T1D-associated PTPN2 gene polymorphisms. Tregs from individuals with lower IL-2 signaling were reduced in frequency, were less able to maintain expression of FOXP3 under limiting concentrations of IL-2, and displayed reduced suppressor function.

"668819","Journal article","06/02/2015",,"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Type 1 diabetes results from the autoimmune destruction of insulin-secreting pancreatic beta cells by T cells. Despite the established role of T cells in the pathogenesis of the disease, to date, with the exception of the identification of islet-specific T effector (Teff) cells, studies have mostly failed to identify reproducible alterations in the frequency or function of T cell subsets in peripheral blood from patients with type 1 diabetes. METHODS: We assessed the production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-21, IFN-γ and IL-17 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 69 patients with type 1 diabetes and 61 healthy donors. In an additional cohort of 30 patients with type 1 diabetes and 32 healthy donors, we assessed the frequency of circulating T follicular helper (Tfh) cells in whole blood. IL-21 and IL-17 production was also measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a subset of 46 of the 62 donors immunophenotyped for Tfh.

"668818","Journal article","01/02/2015",,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with many traits and diseases.

"674597","Journal article","01/01/2015",,"© 2015, The Author(s). Aims/hypothesis: Type 1 diabetes results from the autoimmune destruction of insulin-secreting pancreatic beta cells by T cells. Despite the established role of T cells in the pathogenesis of the disease, to date, with the exception of the identification of islet-specific T effector (Teff) cells, studies have mostly failed to identify reproducible alterations in the frequency or function of T cell subsets in peripheral blood from patients with type 1 diabetes. Methods: We assessed the production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-21, IFN-γ and IL-17 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 69 patients with type 1 diabetes and 61 healthy donors. In an additional cohort of 30 patients with type 1 diabetes and 32 healthy donors, we assessed the frequency of circulating T follicular helper (Tfh) cells in whole blood. IL-21 and IL-17 production was also measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a subset of 46 of the 62 donors immunophenotyped for Tfh. Results: We found a 21.9% (95% CI 5.8, 40.2; p = 3.9 × 10 −3 ) higher frequency of IL-21 +  CD45RA −  memory CD4 +  Teffs in patients with type 1 diabetes (geometric mean 5.92% [95% CI 5.44, 6.44]) compared with healthy donors (geometric mean 4.88% [95% CI 4.33, 5.50] ). Consistent with this finding, we found a 14.9% increase in circulating Tfh cells in the patients (95% CI 2.9, 26.9; p = 0.016). Conclusions/interpretation: These results indicate that increased IL-21 production is likely to be an aetiological factor in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes that could be considered as a potential therapeutic target.",,"",,,"Ferreira RC, Simons HZ, Thompson WS, Cutler AJ, Dopico XC, Smyth DJ, Mashar M, Schuilenburg H, Walker NM, Dunger DB, Wallace C, Todd JA, Wicker LS, Pekalski ML",,"",,"10.1007/s00125-015-3509-8",,"","1432-0428",,"pubmed:25652388",,,,"0012-186X","4","Diabetologia","",,,,,,,,,"781","790",,,"2015-03-06","Published",,,,,,,,,"IL-21 production by CD4<sup>+</sup> effector T cells and frequency of circulating follicular helper T cells are increased in type 1 diabetes patients","Journal Article","58",,,,,,,"25","Diabetologia (1432-0428)","3.158","Diabetologia (0012-186X)","1.732","No",,"none",,"0","","No","Not deposited","Unknown","2-s2.0-84925490425","Scopus","Diabetologia","SJR"

"632361","Journal article","28/04/2014",,"The appearance of circulating islet-specific autoantibodies before disease diagnosis is a hallmark of human type 1 diabetes (T1D), and suggests a role for B cells in the pathogenesis of the disease. Alterations in the peripheral B cell compartment have been reported in T1D patients; however, to date, such studies have produced conflicting results and have been limited by sample size. In this study, we have performed a detailed characterization of the B cell compartment in T1D patients (n = 45) and healthy controls (n = 46), and assessed the secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 in purified B cells from the same donors.

"629197","Journal article","11/04/2014",,"BACKGROUND: Killer Immunoglobulin-like Receptors (KIRs) are surface receptors of natural killer cells that bind to their corresponding Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class I ligands, making them interesting candidate genes for HLA-associated autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, allelic and copy number variation in the KIR region effectively mask it from standard genome-wide association studies: single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) probes targeting the region are often discarded by standard genotype callers since they exhibit variable cluster numbers. Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) assays address this issue. However, their cost is prohibitive at the sample sizes required for detecting effects typically observed in complex genetic diseases. RESULTS: We propose a more powerful and cost-effective alternative, which combines signals from SNPs with more than three clusters found in existing datasets, with qPCR on a subset of samples. First, we showed that noise and batch effects in multiplexed qPCR assays are addressed through normalisation and simultaneous copy number calling of multiple genes. Then, we used supervised classification to impute copy numbers of specific KIR genes from SNP signals. We applied this method to assess copy number variation in two KIR genes, KIR3DL1 and KIR3DS1, which are suitable candidates for T1D susceptibility since they encode the only KIR molecules known to bind with HLA-Bw4 epitopes. We find no association between KIR3DL1/3DS1 copy number and T1D in 6744 cases and 5362 controls; a sample size twenty-fold larger than in any previous KIR association study. Due to our sample size, we can exclude odds ratios larger than 1.1 for the common KIR3DL1/3DS1 copy number groups at the 5% significance level. CONCLUSION: We found no evidence of association of KIR3DL1/3DS1 copy number with T1D, either overall or dependent on HLA-Bw4 epitope. Five other KIR genes, KIR2DS4, KIR2DL3, KIR2DL5, KIR2DS5 and KIR2DS1, in high linkage disequilibrium with KIR3DL1 and KIR3DS1, are also unlikely to be significantly associated.

"624206","Journal article","21/02/2014",,"Diagnosis of the autoimmune disease type 1 diabetes (T1D) is preceded by the appearance of circulating autoantibodies to pancreatic islets. However, almost nothing is known about events leading to this islet autoimmunity. Previous epidemiological and genetic data have associated viral infections and antiviral type I interferon (IFN) immune response genes with T1D. Here, we first used DNA microarray analysis to identify IFN-β-inducible genes in vitro and then used this set of genes to define an IFN-inducible transcriptional signature in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a group of active systemic lupus erythematosus patients (n = 25). Using this predefined set of 225 IFN signature genes, we investigated the expression of the signature in cohorts of healthy controls (n = 87), patients with T1D (n = 64), and a large longitudinal birth cohort of children genetically predisposed to T1D (n = 109; 454 microarrayed samples). Expression of the IFN signature was increased in genetically predisposed children before the development of autoantibodies (P = 0.0012) but not in patients with established T1D. Upregulation of IFN-inducible genes was transient, temporally associated with a recent history of upper respiratory tract infections (P = 0.0064), and marked by increased expression of SIGLEC-1 (CD169), a lectin-like receptor expressed on CD14(+) monocytes. DNA variation in IFN-inducible genes altered T1D risk (P = 0.007), as exemplified by IFIH1, one of the genes in our IFN signature for which increased expression is a known risk factor for disease. These findings identify transient increased expression of type I IFN genes in preclinical diabetes as a risk factor for autoimmunity in children with a genetic predisposition to T1D.

RESULTS: We identified that sCD25 was increased in patients with type 1 diabetes compared with controls and replicated this result in an independent set of 86 adult patient and 80 age-matched control samples (p = 1.17 × 10(-3)). In 230 patients under 20 years of age, with median duration-of-disease of 6.1 years, concentrations of sCD25 were negatively associated with C-peptide concentrations (p = 4.8 × 10(-3)).
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The 25% increase in sCD25 in patients, alongside the inverse association between sCD25 and C-peptide, probably reflect the adverse effects of an on-going, actively autoimmune and inflammatory immune system on beta cell function in patients.",,"",,,"Downes K, Marcovecchio ML, Clarke P, Cooper JD, Ferreira RC, Howson JMM, Jolley JD, Nutland S, Stevens H, Walker NM",,"",,"10.1007/s00125-013-3113-8",,"",,,"pubmed:24264051",,,,,"2","Diabetologia","1107 Immunology, 1103 Clinical Sciences, Biomedical, Basic Science, Autoimmune Disease, Clinical Research, Genetics, Diabetes, Inflammatory and Immune System, Metabolic and Endocrine, 2.1 Biological and endogenous factors",,,,,,,,,"366","372",,,"2014-02","Published",,,,,,,"0.7238513",,"Plasma concentrations of soluble IL-2 receptor α (CD25) are increased in type 1 diabetes and associated with reduced C-peptide levels in young patients.","Journal Article","57",,,,,,,,"Diabetologia (1432-0428)","3.158","Diabetologia (0012-186X)","1.732","No",,"none",,"0","","No","Not deposited","Unknown","24264051","Dimensions for Universities","Diabetologia","SJR"

"458470","Journal article","04/09/2012",,"Autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), including Graves' disease (GD) and Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), is one of the most common of the immune-mediated diseases. To further investigate the genetic determinants of AITD, we conducted an association study using a custom-made single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, the ImmunoChip.

"549615","Journal article","11/11/2011",,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common cause of morbidity and mortality and has a significant heritability. We carried out a genome-wide association discovery study of 1866 patients with AAA and 5435 controls and replication of promising signals (lead SNP with a p value < 1 × 10(-5)) in 2871 additional cases and 32,687 controls and performed further follow-up in 1491 AAA and 11,060 controls. In the discovery study, nine loci demonstrated association with AAA (p < 1 × 10(-5)). In the replication sample, the lead SNP at one of these loci, rs1466535, located within intron 1 of low-density-lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) demonstrated significant association (p = 0.0042). We confirmed the association of rs1466535 and AAA in our follow-up study (p = 0.035). In a combined analysis (6228 AAA and 49182 controls), rs1466535 had a consistent effect size and direction in all sample sets (combined p = 4.52 × 10(-10), odds ratio 1.15 [1.10-1.21]). No associations were seen for either rs1466535 or the 12q13.3 locus in independent association studies of coronary artery disease, blood pressure, diabetes, or hyperlipidaemia, suggesting that this locus is specific to AAA.

"391471","Journal article","01/11/2011",,"BACKGROUND: The genetic basis of the autoimmune disease type 1 diabetes (T1D) has now been largely determined, so now we can compare these findings with emerging genetic knowledge of disorders and phenotypes that have been negatively or positively associated with T1D historically. Here, we assessed the role in T1D of variants previously reported to be associated with atopic diseases and epithelial barrier function, profilaggrin (FLG), and those that affect the expression levels of the proinflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, interferon (IFN)γ and IL-18.
METHODS: We genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): -105/rs28665122 in SELS or SEPS1 (selenoprotein), three single nucleotide polymorphisms in IL18 (-105/rs360717, +183/rs5744292 and +1467/rs574456) and R501X/rs61816761 in FLG, the major locus associated with atopic dermatitis and predisposing to asthma, in a minimum of 6743 T1D cases and 7864 controls.
RESULTS: No evidence of T1D association was found for any of the SNPs we genotyped at FLG, SELS or IL18 (p≥0.03), nor with haplotypes of IL18 (p=0.82). Review of previous T1D genome-wide association results revealed that four (human leucocyte antigen (HLA), gasdermin B/ORM1 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)-like/gasdermin B/, GSDMB/ORMDL3/GSDMA and IL2RB) of ten loci recently reported to be associated with asthma were associated with T1D (p≤0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: These results show that there are shared genetic associations for atopy-related traits and T1D, and this might help in the future to understand the mechanisms, pathways and environmental factors that underpin the rapid rise in incidence of both disorders in children.

"376725","Journal article","30/07/2011",,"AIMS: To evaluate the associations of emergent genome-wide-association study-derived coronary heart disease (CHD)-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with established and emerging risk factors, and the association of genome-wide-association study-derived lipid-associated SNPs with other risk factors and CHD events. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using two case-control studies, three cross-sectional, and seven prospective studies with up to 25 000 individuals and 5794 CHD events we evaluated associations of 34 genome-wide-association study-identified SNPs with CHD risk and 16 CHD-associated risk factors or biomarkers. The Ch9p21 SNPs rs1333049 (OR 1.17; 95% confidence limits 1.11-1.24) and rs10757274 (OR 1.17; 1.09-1.26), MIA3 rs17465637 (OR 1.10; 1.04-1.15), Ch2q36 rs2943634 (OR 1.08; 1.03-1.14), APC rs383830 (OR 1.10; 1.02, 1.18), MTHFD1L rs6922269 (OR 1.10; 1.03, 1.16), CXCL12 rs501120 (OR 1.12; 1.04, 1.20), and SMAD3 rs17228212 (OR 1.11; 1.05, 1.17) were all associated with CHD risk, but not with the CHD biomarkers and risk factors measured. Among the 20 blood lipid-related SNPs, LPL rs17411031 was associated with a lower risk of CHD (OR 0.91; 0.84-0.97), an increase in Apolipoprotein AI and HDL-cholesterol, and reduced triglycerides. SORT1 rs599839 was associated with CHD risk (OR 1.20; 1.15-1.26) as well as total- and LDL-cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B. ANGPTL3 rs12042319 was associated with CHD risk (OR 1.11; 1.03, 1.19), total- and LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and interleukin-6. CONCLUSION: Several SNPs predicting CHD events appear to involve pathways not currently indexed by the established or emerging risk factors; others involved changes in blood lipids including triglycerides or HDL-cholesterol as well as LDL-cholesterol.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We measured 25(OH)D concentrations in 720 case and 2,610 control plasma samples and genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms from seven vitamin D metabolism genes in 8,517 case, 10,438 control, and 1,933 family samples. We tested genetic variants influencing 25(OH)D metabolism for an association with both circulating 25(OH)D concentrations and disease status. RESULTS: Type 1 diabetic patients have lower circulating levels of 25(OH)D than similarly aged subjects from the British population. Only 4.3 and 18.6% of type 1 diabetic patients reached optimal levels (≥75 nmol/L) of 25(OH)D for bone health in the winter and summer, respectively. We replicated the associations of four vitamin D metabolism genes (GC, DHCR7, CYP2R1, and CYP24A1) with 25(OH)D in control subjects.

"269692","Journal article","25/03/2011",,"OBJECTIVE: Vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] <50 nmol/L) is commonly reported in both children and adults worldwide, and growing evidence indicates that vitamin D deficiency is associated with many extraskeletal chronic disorders, including the autoimmune diseases type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We measured 25(OH)D concentrations in 720 case and 2,610 control plasma samples and genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms from seven vitamin D metabolism genes in 8,517 case, 10,438 control, and 1,933 family samples. We tested genetic variants influencing 25(OH)D metabolism for an association with both circulating 25(OH)D concentrations and disease status.
RESULTS: Type 1 diabetic patients have lower circulating levels of 25(OH)D than similarly aged subjects from the British population. Only 4.3 and 18.6% of type 1 diabetic patients reached optimal levels (≥75 nmol/L) of 25(OH)D for bone health in the winter and summer, respectively. We replicated the associations of four vitamin D metabolism genes (GC, DHCR7, CYP2R1, and CYP24A1) with 25(OH)D in control subjects. In addition to the previously reported association between type 1 diabetes and CYP27B1 (P = 1.4 × 10(-4)), we obtained consistent evidence of type 1 diabetes being associated with DHCR7 (P = 1.2 × 10(-3)) and CYP2R1 (P = 3.0 × 10(-3)).
CONCLUSIONS: Circulating levels of 25(OH)D in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes vary seasonally and are under the same genetic control as in the general population but are much lower.

Because recent genome-wide association (GWA) studies have linked a region of the 3'-UTR of IKZF1 with C-ALL susceptibility, we tested whether IKZF1 is associated with the autoimmune disease type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: rs10272724 (T>C) near IKZF1 at 7p12 was genotyped in 8,333 individuals with type 1 diabetes, 9,947 control subjects, and 3,997 families of European ancestry. Association was tested using logistic regression in the case-control data and by the transmission disequilibrium test in the families. Expression data for IKZF1 by rs10272724 genotype were obtained using quantitative PCR of mRNA/cDNA generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 88 individuals, whereas expression data for five other neighboring genes were obtained from the online Genevar dataset.

"232368","Journal article","01/01/2011",,"BACKGROUND: We tested whether genetic factors distinctly contribute to either development of coronary atherosclerosis or, specifically, to myocardial infarction in existing coronary atherosclerosis. METHODS: We did two genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with coronary angiographic phenotyping in participants of European ancestry. To identify loci that predispose to angiographic coronary artery disease (CAD), we compared individuals who had this disorder (n=12,393) with those who did not (controls, n=7383). To identify loci that predispose to myocardial infarction, we compared patients who had angiographic CAD and myocardial infarction (n=5783) with those who had angiographic CAD but no myocardial infarction (n=3644). FINDINGS: In the comparison of patients with angiographic CAD versus controls, we identified a novel locus, ADAMTS7 (p=4·98×10(-13)). In the comparison of patients with angiographic CAD who had myocardial infarction versus those with angiographic CAD but no myocardial infarction, we identified a novel association at the ABO locus (p=7·62×10(-9)). The ABO association was attributable to the glycotransferase-deficient enzyme that encodes the ABO blood group O phenotype previously proposed to protect against myocardial infarction. INTERPRETATION: Our findings indicate that specific genetic predispositions promote the development of coronary atherosclerosis whereas others lead to myocardial infarction in the presence of coronary atherosclerosis. The relation to specific CAD phenotypes might modify how novel loci are applied in personalised risk assessment and used in the development of novel therapies for CAD. FUNDING: The PennCath and MedStar studies were supported by the Cardiovascular Institute of the University of Pennsylvania, by the MedStar Health Research Institute at Washington Hospital Center and by a research grant from GlaxoSmithKline.

"232368","Journal article","01/01/2011",,"BACKGROUND: We tested whether genetic factors distinctly contribute to either development of coronary atherosclerosis or, specifically, to myocardial infarction in existing coronary atherosclerosis.
METHODS: We did two genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with coronary angiographic phenotyping in participants of European ancestry. To identify loci that predispose to angiographic coronary artery disease (CAD), we compared individuals who had this disorder (n=12,393) with those who did not (controls, n=7383). To identify loci that predispose to myocardial infarction, we compared patients who had angiographic CAD and myocardial infarction (n=5783) with those who had angiographic CAD but no myocardial infarction (n=3644).
FINDINGS: In the comparison of patients with angiographic CAD versus controls, we identified a novel locus, ADAMTS7 (p=4·98×10(-13)). In the comparison of patients with angiographic CAD who had myocardial infarction versus those with angiographic CAD but no myocardial infarction, we identified a novel association at the ABO locus (p=7·62×10(-9)). The ABO association was attributable to the glycotransferase-deficient enzyme that encodes the ABO blood group O phenotype previously proposed to protect against myocardial infarction.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings indicate that specific genetic predispositions promote the development of coronary atherosclerosis whereas others lead to myocardial infarction in the presence of coronary atherosclerosis. The relation to specific CAD phenotypes might modify how novel loci are applied in personalised risk assessment and used in the development of novel therapies for CAD.
FUNDING: The PennCath and MedStar studies were supported by the Cardiovascular Institute of the University of Pennsylvania, by the MedStar Health Research Institute at Washington Hospital Center and by a research grant from GlaxoSmithKline.

"403705","Journal article","01/01/2011",,"Raised blood pressure (BP) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Previous studies have identified 47 distinct genetic variants robustly associated with BP, but collectively these explain only a few percent of the heritability for BP phenotypes. To find additional BP loci, we used a bespoke gene-centric array to genotype an independent discovery sample of 25,118 individuals that combined hypertensive case-control and general population samples. We followed up four SNPs associated with BP at our p < 8.56 × 10(-7) study-specific significance threshold and six suggestively associated SNPs in a further 59,349 individuals. We identified and replicated a SNP at LSP1/TNNT3, a SNP at MTHFR-NPPB independent (r(2) = 0.33) of previous reports, and replicated SNPs at AGT and ATP2B1 reported previously. An analysis of combined discovery and follow-up data identified SNPs significantly associated with BP at p < 8.56 × 10(-7) at four further loci (NPR3, HFE, NOS3, and SOX6).

This common amino acid substitution does not cause a loss of function and evidence suggests the protective allele, Ala(946), may mark a haplotype with reduced expression of IFIH1 in line with the protection conferred by the four rare loss of function alleles. We have performed allele specific expression analysis that supports this hypothesis: the T1D protective haplotype correlates with reduced IFIH1 transcription in interferon-β stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (overall p = 0.012). In addition, we have used multiflow cytometry analysis and quantitative PCR assays to prove reduced expression of IFIH1 in individuals heterozygous for three of the T1D-associated rare alleles: a premature stop codon, rs35744605 (Glu627X) and predicted splice variants, rs35337543 (IVS8+1) and rs35732034 (IVS14+1). We also show that the nsSNP, Ile923V, does not alter pre-mRNA levels of IFIH1. These results confirm and extend the new autoimmune disease pathway of reduced IFIH1 expression and protein function protecting from T1D.",,"",,,"Downes K, Pekalski ML, Angus KL, Hardy M, Nutland S, Smyth DJ, Walker NM, Wallace C, Todd JA",,"",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0012646",,"",,,"pubmed:20844740",,,,,"9","PloS one","1107 Immunology, Biomedical, Basic Science, Pediatric, Autoimmune Disease, Genetics, Diabetes, Metabolic and Endocrine, 2.1 Biological and endogenous factors",,,,,,,,,,,,,"2010-09-09","Published",,,,,,,"1.441045",,"Reduced expression of IFIH1 is protective for type 1 diabetes.","Journal Article","5",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","","No","Not deposited","Unknown","20844740","Dimensions for Universities","PLoS ONE","DOAJ"

"315681","Journal article","01/06/2009",,"Elevated serum uric acid levels cause gout and are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. To investigate the polygenetic basis of serum uric acid levels, we conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association scans from 14 studies totalling 28,141 participants of European descent, resulting in identification of 954 SNPs distributed across nine loci that exceeded the threshold of genome-wide significance, five of which are novel. Overall, the common variants associated with serum uric acid levels fall in the following nine regions: SLC2A9 (p = 5.2x10(-201)), ABCG2 (p = 3.1x10(-26)), SLC17A1 (p = 3.0x10(-14)), SLC22A11 (p = 6.7x10(-14)), SLC22A12 (p = 2.0x10(-9)), SLC16A9 (p = 1.1x10(-8)), GCKR (p = 1.4x10(-9)), LRRC16A (p = 8.5x10(-9)), and near PDZK1 (p = 2.7x10(-9)). Identified variants were analyzed for gender differences. We found that the minor allele for rs734553 in SLC2A9 has greater influence in lowering uric acid levels in women and the minor allele of rs2231142 in ABCG2 elevates uric acid levels more strongly in men compared to women.

To investigate the polygenetic basis of serum uric acid levels, we conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association scans from 14 studies totalling 28,141 participants of European descent, resulting in identification of 954 SNPs distributed across nine loci that exceeded the threshold of genome-wide significance, five of which are novel. Overall, the common variants associated with serum uric acid levels fall in the following nine regions: SLC2A9 (p = 5.2×10 -201 ), ABCG2 (p = 3.1×10 -26 ), SLC17A1 (p = 3.0×10 -14 ), SLC22A11 (p = 6.7×10 -14 ), SLC22A12 (p = 2.0×10 -9 ), SLC16A9 (p = 1.1×10 -8 ), GCKR (p = 1.4×10 -9 ), LRRC16A (p = 8.5×10 -9 ), and near PDZK1 (p = 2.7×10  -9 ). Identified variants were analyzed for gender differences. We found that the minor allele for rs734553 in SLC2A9 has greater influence in lowering uric acid levels in women and the minor allele of rs2231142 in ABCG2 elevates uric acid levels more strongly in men compared to women.

"306988","Journal article","01/01/2009",,"WNK1--a serine/threonine kinase involved in electrolyte homeostasis and blood pressure (BP) control--is an excellent candidate gene for essential hypertension (EH). We and others have previously reported association between WNK1 and BP variation. Using tag SNPs (tSNPs) that capture 100% of common WNK1 variation in HapMap, we aimed to replicate our findings with BP and to test for association with phenotypes relating to WNK1 function in the British Genetics of Hypertension (BRIGHT) study case-control resource (1700 hypertensive cases and 1700 normotensive controls). We found multiple variants to be associated with systolic blood pressure, SBP (7/28 tSNPs min-p = 0.0005), diastolic blood pressure, DBP (7/28 tSNPs min-p = 0.002) and 24 hour urinary potassium excretion (10/28 tSNPs min-p = 0.0004). Associations with SBP and urine potassium remained significant after correction for multiple testing (p = 0.02 and p = 0.01 respectively). The major allele (A) of rs765250, located in intron 1, demonstrated the strongest evidence for association with SBP, effect size 3.14 mmHg (95%CI:1.23-4.9), DBP 1.9 mmHg (95%CI:0.7-3.2) and hypertension, odds ratio (OR: 1.3 [95%CI: 1.0-1.7]).We genotyped this variant in six independent populations (n = 14,451) and replicated the association between rs765250 and SBP in a meta-analysis (p = 7 x 10(-3), combined with BRIGHT data-set p = 2 x 10(-4), n = 17,851).

"185217","Journal article","01/10/2008",,"BACKGROUND: Serum uric acid levels in humans are influenced by diet, cellular breakdown, and renal elimination, and correlate with blood pressure, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, gout, and cardiovascular disease. Recent genome-wide association scans have found common genetic variants of SLC2A9 to be associated with increased serum urate level and gout. The SLC2A9 gene encodes a facilitative glucose transporter, and it has two splice variants that are highly expressed in the proximal nephron, a key site for urate handling in the kidney. We investigated whether SLC2A9 is a functional urate transporter that contributes to the longstanding association between urate and blood pressure in man. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We expressed both SLC2A9 splice variants in Xenopus laevis oocytes and found both isoforms mediate rapid urate fluxes at concentration ranges similar to physiological serum levels (200-500 microM). Because SLC2A9 is a known facilitative glucose transporter, we also tested whether glucose or fructose influenced urate transport. We found that urate is transported by SLC2A9 at rates 45- to 60-fold faster than glucose, and demonstrated that SLC2A9-mediated urate transport is facilitated by glucose and, to a lesser extent, fructose. In addition, transport is inhibited by the uricosuric benzbromarone in a dose-dependent manner (Ki = 27 microM). Furthermore, we found urate uptake was at least 2-fold greater in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells overexpressing SLC2A9 splice variants than nontransfected kidney cells. To confirm that our findings were due to SLC2A9, and not another urate transporter, we showed that urate transport was diminished by SLC2A9-targeted siRNA in a second mammalian cell line. In a cohort of men we showed that genetic variants of SLC2A9 are associated with reduced urinary urate clearance, which fits with common variation at SLC2A9 leading to increased serum urate. We found no evidence of association with hypertension (odds ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9 to 1.05, p > 0.33) by meta-analysis of an SLC2A9 variant in six case-control studies including 11,897 participants. In a separate meta-analysis of four population studies including 11,629 participants we found no association of SLC2A9 with systolic (effect size -0.12 mm Hg, 95% CI -0.68 to 0.43, p = 0.664) or diastolic blood pressure (effect size -0.03 mm Hg, 95% CI -0.39 to 0.31, p = 0.82). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that SLC2A9 splice variants act as high-capacity urate transporters and is one of the first functional characterisations of findings from genome-wide association scans. We did not find an association of the SLC2A9 gene with blood pressure in this study. Our findings suggest potential pathogenic mechanisms that could offer a new drug target for gout.","2008-08-26","",,,"Caulfield MJ, Munroe PB, O'Neill D, Witkowska K, Charchar FJ, Doblado M, Evans S, Eyheramendy S, Onipinla A, Howard P","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18842065","",,"10.1371/journal.pmed.0050197",,"","1549-1676",,"pmc:PMC2561076",,,,,"10","PLoS Med","Adult, Aged, Animals, Biological Transport, Blotting, Western, Cell Line, Cell Line, Tumor, Chromatography, Thin Layer, Fatty Acids, Volatile, Female, Fructose, Glucose, Glucose Transport Proteins, Facilitative, Hexoses, Humans, Immunohistochemistry, Kinetics, Longitudinal Studies, Mice, Middle Aged, Oocytes, Organic Anion Transporters, Uric Acid, Uricosuric Agents, Xenopus laevis","eng","United States",,,,,,,"e197",,,"08-PLME-RA-0340","2008-10-07","Published",,,,,"2008-10-30","2009-01-05",,,"SLC2A9 is a high-capacity urate transporter in humans.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","5",,,,,,,,"PLoS Medicine (1549-1676)","5.951",,,"Yes","CC BY","none",,"0","","No","Not deposited","Unknown","18842065","PubMed","PLoS Medicine","DOAJ"

METHODS: We screened 83 patients with hypertension and 46 controls for single nucleotide polymorphisms in GSTM genes by TaqMan single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping assays and DNA sequencing. We then genotyped 753 trios from the Medical Research Council British Genetics of Hypertension Study transmission disequilibrium test cohort for 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms and the GSTM1 deletion and examined renal GSTM expression in a cohort of 27 hypertensive and 18 normotensive subjects. Finally, we attempted to replicate our findings in 1675 cases and 1654 controls from the Medical Research Council British Genetics of Hypertension Study case-control cohort. RESULTS: We identified two major linkage disequilibrium blocks including GSTM4/GSTM2 and GSTM5/GSTM3 separated by the GSTM1 gene. In the British Genetics of Hypertension transmission disequilibrium test resource, a single nucleotide polymorphism in the 3' region of GSTM5 (rs11807) was found to be associated with hypertension (P = 0.01) with the T-allele being over-transmitted to hypertensive offspring. GSTM5 mRNA expression was found to be reduced in kidney tissue of subjects homozygous for the T-allele of rs11807 as compared to C-allele homozygous and CT heterozygous subjects (P = 0.02). Nevertheless, rs11807 was not associated with hypertension in the British Genetics of Hypertension case-control cohort (P = 0.61). CONCLUSION: Our studies do not provide an evidence of an association of GSTM gene variants with hypertension in humans. They, however, illustrate the essential role of replication of initial results in a second cohort.",,"",,,"Delles C, Padmanabhan S, Lee WK, Miller WH, McBride MW, McClure JD, Brain NJ, Wallace C, Marçano ACB, Schmieder RE","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18551009","",,"10.1097/HJH.0b013e3282fe1d67",,"",,,"",,,,"0263-6352","7","J Hypertens","Adult, Female, Genotype, Glutathione Transferase, Humans, Hypertension, Linkage Disequilibrium, Male, Middle Aged, Oxidative Stress, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide","eng","England",,,,,,,"1343","1352",,"00004872-200807000-00014","2008-07","Published",,,,,"2008-06-13","2008-10-23",,,"Glutathione S-transferase variants and hypertension.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","26",,,,,,,,"Journal of Hypertension (0263-6352)","2.065","Journal of Hypertension (0263-6352)","1.857","No",,"none",,"0","","No","Not deposited","Unknown","18551009","PubMed","Journal of Hypertension","SJR"

"306922","Journal article","01/01/2008",,"Background: Serum uric acid levels in humans are influenced by diet, cellular breakdown, and renal elimination, and correlate with blood pressure, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, gout, and cardiovascular disease. Recent genome-wide association scans have found common genetic variants of SLC2A9 to be associated with increased serum urate level and gout. The SLC2A9 gene encodes a facilitative glucose transporter, and it has two splice variants that are highly expressed in the proximal nephron, a key site for urate handling in the kidney. We investigated whether SLC2A9 is a functional urate transporter that contributes to the longstanding association between urate and blood pressure in man. Methods and Findings: We expressed both SLC2A9 splice variants in Xenopus laevis oocytes and found both isoforms mediate rapid urate fluxes at concentration ranges similar to physiological serum levels (200-500 μM). Because SLC2A9 is a known facilitative glucose transporter, we also tested whether glucose or fructose influenced urate transport. We found that urate is transported by SLC2A9 at rates 45-to 60-fold faster than glucose, and demonstrated that SLC2A9-mediated urate transport is facilitated by glucose and, to a lesser extent, fructose. In addition, transport is inhibited by the uricosuric benzbromarone in a dose-dependent manner (K i  = 27 μM). Furthermore, we found urate uptake was at least 2-fold greater in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells overexpressing SLC2A9 splice variants than nontransfected kidney cells. To confirm that our findings were due to SLC2A9, and not another urate transporter, we showed that urate transport was diminished by SLC2A9-targeted siRNA in a second mammalian cell line. In a cohort of men we showed that genetic variants of SLC2A9 are associated with reduced urinary urate clearance, which fits with common variation at SLC2A9 leading to increased serum urate. We found no evidence of association with hypertension (odds ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9 to 1.05, p  >  0.33) by meta-analysis of an SLC2A9 variant in six case-control studies including 11,897 participants. In a separate meta-analysis of four population studies including 11,629 participants we found no association of SLC2A9 with systolic (effect size -0.12 mm Hg, 95% CI -0.68 to 0.43, p = 0.664) or diastolic blood pressure (effect size -0.03 mm Hg, 95% CI -0.39 to 0.31, p = 0.82). Conclusions: This study provides evidence that SLC2A9 splice variants act as high-capacity urate transporters and is one of the first functional characterisations of findings from genome-wide association scans. We did not find an association of the SLC2A9 gene with blood pressure in this study. Our findings suggest potential pathogenic mechanisms that could offer a new drug target for gout. © 2008 Caulfield et al.",,"",,,"Caulfield MJ, Munroe PB, O'Neill D, Witkowska K, Charchar FJ, Doblado M, Evans S, Eyheramendy S, Onipinla A, Howard P, Shaw-Hawkins S, Dobson RJ, Wallace C, Newhouse SJ, Brown M, Connell JM, Dominiczak A, Farrall M, Lathrop GM, Samani NJ, Kumari M, Marmot M, Brunner E, Chambers J, Elliott P, Kooner J, Laan M, Org E, Veldre G, Viigimaa M, Cappuccio FP, Ji C, Iacone R, Strazzullo P, Moley KH, Cheeseman C",,"",,"10.1371/journal.pmed.0050197",,"","1549-1676",,"pubmed:18842065",,,,"1549-1277","10","PLoS Medicine","",,,,,,,,,"1509","1523",,,"2008-10-01","Published",,,,,,,,,"SLC2A9 is a high-capacity urate transporter in humans","Journal Article","5",,,,,,,"171","PLoS Medicine (1549-1676)","5.951",,,"Yes","CC BY","none",,"0","","No","Not deposited","Unknown","2-s2.0-55949096514","Scopus","PLoS Medicine","DOAJ"

Identifying the genetic determinants could provide novel insights into disease mechanisms and reveal avenues for developing new therapies. Here, we report a genome-wide association analysis for commonly measured serum and urine biochemical traits. As part of the WTCCC, 500,000 SNPs genome wide were genotyped in 1955 hypertensive individuals characterized for 25 serum and urine biochemical traits. For each trait, we assessed association with individual SNPs, adjusting for age, sex, and BMI. Lipid measurements were further examined in a meta-analysis of genome-wide data from a type 2 diabetes scan. The most promising associations were examined in two epidemiological cohorts. We discovered association between serum urate and SLC2A9, a glucose transporter (p = 2 x 10(-15)) and confirmed this in two independent cohorts, GRAPHIC study (p = 9 x 10(-15)) and TwinsUK (p = 8 x 10(-19)). The odds ratio for hyperuricaemia (defined as urate >0.4 mMol/l) is 1.89 (95% CI = 1.36-2.61) per copy of common allele. We also replicated many genes previously associated with serum lipids and found previously recognized association between LDL levels and SNPs close to genes encoding PSRC1 and CELSR2 (p = 1 x 10(-7)). The common allele was associated with a 6% increase in nonfasting serum LDL. This region showed increased association in the meta-analysis (p = 4 x 10(-14)). This finding provides a potential biological mechanism for the recent association of this same allele of the same SNP with increased risk of coronary disease.","2007-11-05","",,,"Wallace C, Newhouse SJ, Braund P, Zhang F, Tobin M, Falchi M, Ahmadi K, Dobson RJ, Marçano ACB, Hajat C","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18179892","",,"10.1016/j.ajhg.2007.11.001",,"","1537-6605",,"pmc:PMC2253977",,,,,"1","Am J Hum Genet","Aged, Biomarkers, Cardiovascular Diseases, Dyslipidemias, Female, Genome, Human, Humans, Lipids, Male, Middle Aged, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Uric Acid","eng","United States",,,,,,,"139","149",,"S0002-9297(07)00026-2","2008-01","Published",,,,,"2008-01-08","2008-01-30",,,"Genome-wide association study identifies genes for biomarkers of cardiovascular disease: serum urate and dyslipidemia.","Journal Article, Meta-Analysis, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","82",,,,,,,,"American Journal of Human Genetics (1537-6605)","7.143","American Journal of Human Genetics (0002-9297)","2.860","No",,"none",,"0","","No","Not deposited","Unknown","18179892","PubMed","American Journal of Human Genetics","SJR"

"231342","Journal article","01/01/2008",,"To identify common variants influencing body mass index (BMI), we analyzed genome-wide association data from 16,876 individuals of European descent. After previously reported variants in FTO, the strongest association signal (rs17782313, P = 2.9 x 10(-6)) mapped 188 kb downstream of MC4R (melanocortin-4 receptor), mutations of which are the leading cause of monogenic severe childhood-onset obesity. We confirmed the BMI association in 60,352 adults (per-allele effect = 0.05 Z-score units; P = 2.8 x 10(-15)) and 5,988 children aged 7-11 (0.13 Z-score units; P = 1.5 x 10(-8)). In case-control analyses (n = 10,583), the odds for severe childhood obesity reached 1.30 (P = 8.0 x 10(-11)).

Here, we attempted to validate these and six other top findings in 4,000 individuals with T1D, 5,000 controls and 2,997 family trios independent of the WTCCC study. We confirmed unequivocally the associations of 12q24, 12q13, 16p13 and 18p11 (P(follow-up) <or= 1.35 x 10(-9); P(overall) <or= 1.15 x 10(-14)), leaving eight regions with small effects or false-positive associations.

Here, we attempted to validate these and six other top findings in 4,000 individuals with T1D, 5,000 controls and 2,997 family trios independent of the WTCCC study. We confirmed unequivocally the associations of 12q24, 12q13, 16p13 and 18p11 (P follow-up  ≤ 1.35 × 10  -9 ; P overall  ≤ 1.15 × 10 -14 ), leaving eight regions with small effects or false-positive associations. We also obtained evidence for chromosome 18q22 (P overall  = 1.38 × 10 -8 ) from a GWA study of nonsynonymous SNPs. Several regions, including 18q22 and 18p11, showed association with autoimmune thyroid disease.

"210401","Journal article","01/01/2007",,"The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6 is associated with susceptibility to more common diseases than any other region of the human genome, including almost all disorders classified as autoimmune. In type 1 diabetes the major genetic susceptibility determinants have been mapped to the MHC class II genes HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DRB1 (refs 1-3), but these genes cannot completely explain the association between type 1 diabetes and the MHC region. Owing to the region's extreme gene density, the multiplicity of disease-associated alleles, strong associations between alleles, limited genotyping capability, and inadequate statistical approaches and sample sizes, which, and how many, loci within the MHC determine susceptibility remains unclear. Here, in several large type 1 diabetes data sets, we analyse a combined total of 1,729 polymorphisms, and apply statistical methods - recursive partitioning and regression - to pinpoint disease susceptibility to the MHC class I genes HLA-B and HLA-A (risk ratios  > 1.5; P combined = 2.01 × 10 -19 and 2.35 × 10 -13 , respectively) in addition to the established associations of the MHC class II genes. Other loci with smaller and/or rarer effects might also be involved, but to find these, future searches must take into account both the HLA class II and class I genes and use even larger samples. Taken together with previous studies, we conclude that MHC-class-I-mediated events, principally involving HLA-B*39, contribute to the aetiology of type 1 diabetes. ©2007 Nature Publishing Group.",,"",,,"Nejentsev S, Howson JMM, Walker NM, Szeszko J, Field SF, Stevens HE, Reynolds P, Hardy M, King E, Masters J, Hulme J, Maier LM, Smyth D, Bailey R, Cooper JD, Ribas G, Campbell RD, Clayton DG, Todd JA, Burton PR, Cardon LR, Craddock N, Deloukas P, Duncanson A, Kwiatkowski DP, McCarthy MI, Ouwehand WH, Samani NJ, Donnelly P, Barrett JC, Davison D, Easton D, Evans D, Leung HT, Marchini JL, Morris AP, Spencer CCA, Tobin MD, Attwood AP, Boorman JP, Cant B, Everson U, Hussey JM, Jolley JD, Knight AS, Koch K, Meech E, Nutland S, Prowse CV, Taylor NC, Walters GR, Watkins NA, Winzer T, Jones RW, McArdle WL, Ring SM, Strachan DP, Pembrey M, Breen G, St Clair D, Caesar S, Gordon-Smith K, Jones L, Fraser C, Green EK, Grozeva D, Hamshere ML, Holmans PA, Jones IR, Kirov G, Moskvina V, Nikolov I, O'Donovan MC, Owen MJ, Collier DA, Elkin A, Farmer A, Williamson R, McGuffin P, Young AH, Ferrier IN, Ball SG, Balmforth AJ, Barrett JH, Bishop DT, Iles MM",,"",,"10.1038/nature06406",,"","1476-4687",,"",,,,"0028-0836","7171","Nature","",,,,,,,,,"887","892",,,"2007-12-06","Published",,,,,,,,,"Localization of type 1 diabetes susceptibility to the MHC class I genes HLA-B and HLA-A","Journal Article","450",,,,,,,"321","Nature (1476-4687)","18.134","Nature (0028-0836)","8.377","No",,"none",,"0","","No","Not deposited","Unknown","2-s2.0-36849012027","Scopus","Nature","SJR"

Thirty-four additional microsatellites were genotyped in our severely hypertensive affected sibling pair resource (now 1635 families with 2142 affected sibling pairs), leading to a substantial increase in information content in the regions of interest. We found increased support for linkage of chromosome 5q13 to human hypertension (multipoint logarithm of odds=2.50) with 3 adjacent markers yielding single point logarithm of odds scores of 3.22, 2.84, and 2.51. The placement of additional markers on 2q, 6q, and 9q diminished support for linkage in these regions. However, the addition of new data and families identified novel regions of interest on chromosomes 1q and 11q. The 3 positive markers in the chromosome 5 region were also genotyped in 712 distinct parent-offspring trios with the same severe phenotype to replicate linkage and association.

"376723","Journal article","01/05/2006",,"When conducting genetic studies for complex traits, large samples are commonly required to detect any of the number of genes with relatively low effect thought to underly such traits. This is because, in contrast to monogenic diseases, complex traits typically result from a number of different genetic pathways (genetic heterogeneity) and any sample is likely to contain a considerable fraction of sporadic cases (phenocopies). Such samples are time-consuming and costly to recruit and analyse. Methods which might be used to decrease sample size include attempting to select families, with the aim of reducing genetic heterogeneity or phenocopy rate within the sample. Selecting cases with positive family history of disease should reduce the phenocopy rate, and this strategy has been employed in linkage studies of complex disease, although evaluations of such a strategy have been equivocal. This paper shows how identity by descent (IBD) distributions may be calculated for affected relative pairs recruited conditional on the affection status of a third relative. These distributions are then used to calculate expected power in affected sib and half-sib linkage studies when recruitment is conditional on family history of disease. We consider the proxy conditions of recruitment conditional on disease in an affected parent or third sibling with single-locus and additive multilocus genetic models. We show that while such selection strategies can reduce power if disease risk alleles are common and environmental heterogeneity low, under models more likely to underly common complex diseases power will generally be increased, and that this effect is greater as more loci are involved.

The study cohort comprised 2076 affected sib-pairs and 66 affected half-sib-pairs of the British Genetics of HyperTension study. Extensive simulations were used to establish significance thresholds in the context of 2D genome-scans. Our analyses found significant and suggestive evidence for loci on chromosomes 5, 9, 11, 15, 16 and 19, which influence hypertension when gene-gene interactions are taken into account (5q13.1 and 11q22.1, two-locus lod score=5.72; 5q13.1 and 19q12, two-locus lod score=5.35; 9q22.3 and 15q12, two-locus lod score=4.80; 16p12.3 and 16q23.1, two-locus lod score=4.50). For each significant and suggestive pairwise interaction, the two-locus genetic model that best fitted the data was determined. Regions that were not detected using single-locus linkage analysis were identified in the 2D scan as contributing significant epistatic effects. This approach has discovered novel loci for hypertension and offers a unique potential to use existing data to uncover novel regions involved in complex human diseases.",,"",,,"Bell JT, Wallace C, Dobson R, Wiltshire S, Mein C, Pembroke J, Brown MJ, Clayton DG, Samani NJ, Dominiczak AF",,"",,"10.1093/hmg/ddl058",,"",,,"pubmed:16543358",,,,,"8","Human molecular genetics","0604 Genetics, Basic Science, Human Genome, Clinical Research, Prevention, Genetics, Biotechnology, 1.1 Normal biological development and functioning",,,,,,,,,"1365","1374",,,"2006-04-15","Published",,,,,,,"1.166247",,"Two-dimensional genome-scan identifies novel epistatic loci for essential hypertension.","Journal Article","15",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","","No","Not deposited","Unknown","16543358","Dimensions for Universities","Human Molecular Genetics","SJR"

"315713","Journal article","01/01/2006",,"There is a lack of consistently linked loci influencing blood pressure and hypertension status, and this may be because of genetic or phenotypic heterogeneity. We hypothesize that stratification of subjects by response to antihypertensive drug groups could be used to stringently define subsets that will have reduced genetic and etiologic heterogeneity, by partitioning contrasting mechanisms of hypertension and, thus, enhancing gene finding. We investigated the British Genetics of Hypertension Study population, which is composed of 2142 severely hypertensive white affected sibling pairs. Nonresponse to antihypertensive therapy was defined as an on-treatment blood pressure of  > 140/90 mm Hg or a difference between prediagnosis and on-treatment blood pressure of  < 20 mm Hg. Of the nonresponders, there were 89 sibling pairs (AB) who were both on antihypertensive therapy that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockers, or β-blockers), and 76 sibling pairs (CD) who were both on drugs that do not (calcium channel blockers or diuretics). Nonparametric linkage analysis carried out using markers from a 10-cM genome scan and additional ""grid tightening"" markers showed significant linkage in the AB group on chromosome 2p (logarithm of odds=4.84 at 90.68 Kosambi cM) and suggestive linkage for the CD group on chromosome 10q (logarithm of odds=2.83 at 125.96 Kosambi cM). The AB linkage locus attained genomewide significance after simulation using 10 000 replicates (P=0.005). This locus may contain a gene for the salt-sensitive form of hypertension and/or a pharmacogenetic locus affecting drug response.

"182042","Journal article","01/07/2005",,"Mutations in the WNK1 gene cause Gordon's syndrome, a rare Mendelian form of hypertension. We assessed whether common WNK1 variants might also contribute to essential hypertension (EH), a multifactorial disorder affecting > 25% of the adult population worldwide. A panel of 19 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning the gene was selected from public databases and was genotyped in 100 white European families to determine the pattern of linkage disequilibrium, haplotype structure and tagging SNPs for the WNK1 locus. Eight tagging SNPs were identified with 90% power to predict common WNK1 haplotypes and SNPs. Family-based association tests were used to test for association with EH and severity of hypertension in 712 severely hypertensive families from the MRC British Genetics of Hypertension study resource. No association was found between WNK1 polymorphisms or haplotypes with hypertension; however, one SNP rs1468326, located 3 kb from the WNK1 promoter, was found to be nominally associated with severity of hypertension, with both systolic blood pressure (BP) (Z = +2.24, P = 0.025) and diastolic BP (Z = +1.99, P = 0.046).

"376721","Journal article","01/12/2003",,"The relative recurrence risk ratio lambdaR (and particularly the sibling recurrence risk ratio, lambdaS) is often of interest to those wanting to quantify the genetic contribution towards risk of disease or to discriminate between different genetic models. However, estimating lambdaR for complex diseases for which genetic and environmental risk factors are both involved is not straightforward. Ignoring environmental factors may lead to inflated estimates of lambdaR. We present a marginal model which uses a copula function to model the association in cumulative incidence rates between pairs of relatives. This model is applicable to present-state data and allows estimation of risk of disease in a pair of relatives (and hence lambdaR), given measured environmental covariates. We apply the model to leprosy among sibling pairs from the Karonga district, Malawi. If risk factors are ignored, the apparent lambdaS in this population is over 3.

"940043","Journal article",,,"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The genetic risk of type 1 diabetes has been extensively studied. However, the genetic determinants of age at diagnosis (AAD) of type 1 diabetes remain relatively unexplained. Identification of AAD genes and pathways could provide insight into the earliest events in the disease process. METHODS: Using ImmunoChip data from 15,696 cases, we aimed to identify regions in the genome associated with AAD. RESULTS: Two regions were convincingly associated with AAD (p < 5 × 10(-8)): the MHC on 6p21, and 6q22.33. Fine-mapping of 6q22.33 identified two AAD-associated haplotypes in the region nearest to the genes encoding protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor kappa (PTPRK) and thymocyte-expressed molecule involved in selection (THEMIS). We examined the susceptibility to type 1 diabetes at these SNPs by performing a meta-analysis including 19,510 control participants.

"923050","Journal article",,,"BACKGROUND: Autoimmune disease-associated variants are preferentially found in regulatory regions in immune cells, particularly CD4+ T cells. Linking such regulatory regions to gene promoters in disease-relevant cell contexts facilitates identification of candidate disease genes. RESULTS: Within four hours, activation of CD4+ T cells invokes changes in histone modifications and enhancer RNA transcription that correspond to altered expression of the interacting genes identified by promoter capture Hi-C (PCHi-C). By integrating PCHi-C data with genetic associations for five autoimmune diseases we prioritised 245 candidate genes with a median distance from peak signal to prioritised gene of 153 kb.  Just under half (108/245) prioritised genes related to activation-sensitive interactions.

Here we find in comparisons with healthy donors that the frequency of FOXP3(+) cells within CD127(low)CD25(low) CD4(+) T cells (here defined as CD25(low)FOXP3(+) T cells) is increased in patients affected by autoimmune disease of varying severity, from combined immunodeficiency with active autoimmunity, SLE to type 1 diabetes.
