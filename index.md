Our immune system protects us against infectious disease, but
sometimes attacks our own cells, causing autoimmune disease.  My group
develop and apply statistical genomic methods to understand
the genes, cells and pathways involved in the aetiology of autoimmune
diseases such as type 1 diabetes and the relationships between
different autoimmune diseases.  Our goal is to further the
understanding of these diseases in order to help prevent and treat
them.
