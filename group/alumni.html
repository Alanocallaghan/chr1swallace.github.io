[[http://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/directory/profile.php?lr406][Loes Rutten-Jacobs]] is a British Heart Foundation Immediate Research Fellow in the [[http://www.neurology.cam.ac.uk/neurology-unit-research-groups/stroke-research-group/][Stroke Research Group]] of the Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge and is visiting our group until December 2018. In her research she aims to identify novel pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cerebral small vessel disease, using genetic and epidemiologic approaches.</p>

Chris Eijsbouts first joined the group as an MPhil student in Computational Biology for a 3 month summer project.  He stayed on afterwards as a research assistant, to continue his work on the interpretation of Capture Hi-C data. The goal of this project was to develop a method for improved identification of chromatin contacts which regulate gene expression, thereby facilitating the interpretation of GWAS studies.
He will start a PhD in Oxford in Autumn 2017.</p>

[[https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/steven.kiddle.html][Steven Kiddle]] held an MRC Career Development Fellow in Biostatistics based at King’s College London, on which Chris Wallace was a statistical mentor. He visited our group in Cambridge from 2015-6, working on clustering approaches for time series and biomarkers of Alzheimer’s Disease.</p>

<p>He now holds a new MRC Career Development Fellowship and is based in the  [[http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk][MRC Biostatistics Unit]].</p>

Lucia did her BSc in Mathematics at the University of Newcastle Upon
Tyne and her MPhil in Computational Biology at
Cambridge University. She did her summer project in the Wallace group on
eQTL-GWAS colocalisation analysis to identify causal genes for Type 1
Diabetes. She is now studying for a PhD in Epidemiology at
Imperial College London.</p>

Hui worked as a post doctoral researcher on gene expression data, and led the analysis of our study relating gene expression in PBMCs from children at risk of type 1 diabetes to autoantibody positivity.  She is now a lecturer in biostatistics at [[http://www.population-health.manchester.ac.uk/staff/HuiGuo/][University of Manchester]].
*** Xin Yang (2011-2014)
#+HTML: <img src="pics/xin.jpg" alt="portrait" style="float:left;margin:0 5px 0 0;" />
Xin’s PhD focused on analysis of all kinds of next gen sequencing data - pooled DNA, RNA
seq, and bisulfite seq.  She had a special interest in modelling the extra binomial
variation induced by pooling.  Her thesis [[http://figshare.com/articles/Statistical_analysis_of_next_generation_sequencing_data_with_applications_to_type_1_diabetes_studies/1598221][/Statistical analysis of next-generation sequencing data with applications to type 1 diabetes studies/]] is on figshare.</p>
