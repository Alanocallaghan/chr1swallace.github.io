I am a statistician who works with biological datasets to understand
the mechanisms underlying human disease and identify possible
treatments.  Such work is only possible with close collaboration with
biologists, and I moved to the [[http://www.cimr.cam.ac.uk][Cambridge
Institute for Medical Research]] in 2009 to pursue these
collaborations, most strongly with the [[http://www-gene.cimr.cam.ac.uk][Diabetes and Inflammation
Laboratory]] where I have been head of statistics since 2012.  During
the GWAS era, we, and others, identified many genetic polymorphisms
that alter risk of human diseases such as type 1 diabetes and
hypertension.  My focus has now mostly shifted towards understanding
the cell specific mechanism through which these variants affect risk
of different immune mediated diseases and intermediate biological
traits such as gene expression.
# In Feburary 2016 to the [[http://www.med.cam.ac.uk/][Department of Medicine]] to extend new collaborations.  
Statistically, my current work is focused on variable
selection, Bayesian model averaging and empirical Bayes false
discovery rates, applied to integrated analysis of multiple related
datasets.

I am funded by the [[http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/][Wellcome Trust]].

*Future plans*

In February 2016 I will move to the [[http://www.med.cam.ac.uk/][Department of Medicine]] as a Wellcome Trust Senior Fellow  and take on a more formal visiting position  at the [[http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/][MRC Biostatistics Unit]] as a Visiting Programme Leader.

*Previously* 
- 2003-2008: Research Fellow working with
	  the [[http://www.brightstudy.ac.uk/][BRIGHT]] study into
	  the genetics of hypertension.
- 1999-2003: PhD: "Genetic Susceptibility to leprosy: methodological issues in a linkage
	  analysis of extended pedigrees from Karonga District, Malawi",
