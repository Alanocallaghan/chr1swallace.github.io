*** Chris Wallace

I am a statistician who works with biological datasets to understand
the mechanisms underlying human disease and identify possible
treatments.  Such work is only possible with close collaboration with
biologists, and I moved to the [[http://www.cimr.cam.ac.uk][Cambridge
Institute for Medical Research]] in 2009 to pursue these
collaborations, most closely with the [[http://www-gene.cimr.cam.ac.uk][Diabetes and Inflammation
Laboratory]].  During
the GWAS era, we, and others, identified many genetic polymorphisms
that alter risk of human diseases such as type 1 diabetes and
hypertension.  My focus has now mostly shifted towards understanding
the cell specific mechanism through which these variants affect risk
of different immune mediated diseases and intermediate biological
traits such as gene expression.

Statistically, my current work is focused on variable
selection, Bayesian model averaging and empirical Bayes false
discovery rates, applied to integrated analysis of multiple related
datasets.

In Feburary 2016 I moved to the [[http://www.med.cam.ac.uk/][Department of Medicine]] as a PI with the aim of establishing new collaborations.  
I am funded by the [[http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/][Wellcome Trust]] as a Senior Research Fellow  and hold an honorary Programme Leader  position  at the [[http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/][MRC Biostatistics Unit]].  My aim is to form a group that mixes detailed biological understanding with excellent statistical inference to make a meaningful contribution to the understanding of autoimmune diseases.
