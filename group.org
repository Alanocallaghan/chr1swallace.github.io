I am a statistician who works with biological datasets to understand
the mechanisms underlying human disease and identify possible
treatments.  Such work is only possible with close collaboration with
biologists, and I moved to the [[http://www.cimr.cam.ac.uk][Cambridge Institute for Medical
Research]] in 2009 to pursue these collaborations.  During the GWAS era,
we, and others, identified many genetic polymorphisms that alter risk
of human diseases such as type 1 diabetes and hypertension.  My focus
has now mostly shifted towards understanding the cell specific
mechanism through which these variants affect risk of different immune
mediated diseases and intermediate biological traits such as gene
expression.  Statistically, my current work is focused on variable
selection, Bayesian model averaging and empirical Bayes false
discovery rates, applied to integrated analysis of multiple related
datasets.

Previously:


- 2003-2008: Research Fellow working with
	  the [[http://www.brightstudy.ac.uk/][BRIGHT]] study into
	  the genetics of hypertension.
- 1999-2003: PhD: "Genetic Susceptibility to leprosy: methodological issues in a linkage
	  analysis of extended pedigrees from Karonga District, Malawi",
	  [[http://www.lshtm.ac.uk][LSHTM]], [[http://figshare.com/articles/Human_genetic_susceptibility_to_leprosy_methodological_issues_in_a_linkage_analysis_of_extended_pedigrees_from_Karonga_district_Malawi/963086][thesis]]
	  (part of the
	  [[http://www.lshtm.ac.uk/eph/ide/research/kps][Karonga Prevention Study]]).
- 1997-1999: Statistical
	programmer, [[http://www.imperial.ac.uk][Imperial]].

I contribute to the [[http://dilstats.wordpress.com][DILstats blog]], where you can find details of
recent papers from our group, and keep notes about R and other
code at my [[http://cwcode.wordpress.com][code blog]].

James Liley is a NIHR/BRC funded student on the Wellcome Trust four-year PhD programme in Mathematical Genomics and Medicine. He is working on analysis of GWAS and similar data across multiple diseases and in disease subtypes.
# *** Arcadio Rubio Garcia (PhD student, primary supervisor John Todd)
# Arcadio Rubio Garcia is a PhD student working with sequencing and expression data.

*** Lucia Cilloni (MPhil student)

Lucia did her BSc in Mathematics at the University of Newcastle Upon Tyne and is now completing her MPhil in Computational Biology at Cambridge University. She is currently doing her summer project on eQTL-GWAS colocalisation analysis to identify causal genes for Type 1 Diabetes. Next year she hopes to start her PhD in Epidemiology at Imperial College London.
