---

The [Immunogenomics of Disease](https://coursesandconferences.wellcomegenomecampus.org/our-events/immunogenomics-of-disease-2019/) is happening this week in Hinxton. We will be there in force, with Olly Burren talking about dimension reduction to study autoimmune disease genetics, Elena presenting her work on allele specific expression, and Chris talking about joint fine mapping of immune mediated disease.
