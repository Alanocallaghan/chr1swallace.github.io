title: Anna and Chris speak at Quantitative Genomics 2019

[Quantitative Genomics](https://quantitative-genomics.com/) is a fantastic PhD student organised annual conference that has been running for a few years now.  This year, Chris Wallace gave a keynote talk describing our work leveraging large GWAS datasets to understand the genetics of rare immune-mediated diseases for which standard GWAS approaches require a prohibitive number of samples.  Anna Hutchinson spoke on "Identifying Causal Genetic Variants - Not so credible Credible sets", demonstrating a systematic bias in the frequentist coverage of GWAS fine mapping credible sets and - importantly - a method for correcting it.
