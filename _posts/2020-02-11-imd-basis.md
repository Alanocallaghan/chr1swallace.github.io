By reducing the genome to a radically few 13 immune-focused dimensions, we perform comparative study of the genetics of rare and common immune-mediated diseases, and identify biological co-factors for specific disease clusters, work led by [@ollyburren](https://twitter.com/ollyburren?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfvw)

If you want to explore your GWAS summary data in our immune-mediated disease basis, try our app created by <a href="https://twitter.com/GReales7?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GReales7</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ollyburren?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ollyburren</a>

Also check out our [R package](https://t.co/3zAji1SEuF) to project multiple traits or create your own basis.
